    "Findings:\n",
    "Depression-indicative posts:\n",
    "Focus on self-preoccupation (e.g., \"I’m,\" \"I’m not\").\n",
    "Express feelings (e.g., \"feel,\" \"feel like\").\n",
    "Negative emotions (e.g., \"sad,\" \"depression,\" \"miserable\").\n",
    "Suicidal thoughts (e.g., \"want die,\" \"kill\").\n",
    "Signs of hopelessness (e.g., \"pointless,\" \"need help\").\n",
    "Physical symptoms (e.g., \"tired,\" \"pain,\" \"sleep\").\n",

    "Describe past events (e.g., \"month ago,\" \"last year\").\n",
    "Emphasize social relationships (e.g., \"friend,\" \"family\").\n",
    "Advice-seeking phrases (e.g., \"need advice,\" \"please help\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictive Power:\n",
    "High-frequency depression-indicative words likely improve classification performance since they strongly correlate with depressive language patterns."
