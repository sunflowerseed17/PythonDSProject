I don't know what to do anymore. I am so fucking alone. I am so so sad it makes my body tremble. I've never cried so much in my life. I can barely get out of bed. I can barely go to work. I spend days sometimes without eating., my stomach doesn't even grumble anymore sometimes. I feel like such a worthless person that deserves every bad thing. I deserve for people to not notice I'm suffering. I deserve people labeling me as angry. I deserve people telling me that just don't care that much anymore. I deserve being labeled as a liar. I deserve him telling me he might be falling out of love. I deserve my dad telling me no one will love me. All I wanted was a family, I just wanted to be a mom and I know I'll never have that. So what am I doing? I wish God hadn't wasted a life on me.
