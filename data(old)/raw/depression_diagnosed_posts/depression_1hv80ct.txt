So I’ve been struggling with depression and anxiety for ages now and I only told my parents around a year ago my dad isn’t the best when it comes to mental health he didn’t believe in it. He called my mum nuts and crazy and a psycho and I had to listen to that when I was younger so I was scared to tell him. I did and he would listen and try help. Then he was ok with me at first. Now I could sense he can’t be bothered with me snd like I’m faking it.

I was going on Zoloft and I warned him that he a bit more nice to me an easy because I will be a bit cranky when I start them. And I wasn’t taken off them because I attempted on them.

Now I’m on mirtazapine and my parents stopped taking me to this mental heath hub so I’m not getting out as much. I go to my psychiatrist once every few weeks I told my dad how I felt that we only talked about what anxiety is and breathing and how I don’t think it helps. And he went nuts.

He started saying that I need a boot up the but and he’s sick of me now and he’s sick of me being in my room and he’s sick of me lying. And I’m not I tell him the truth and he says I’m lying he done it with my mum too. All the family hate him no joke no one talks to him no more because all the stupid stuff he does and the anger that comes out him.

The way he spoke to me his 17 year old son and I looked at him and the eyes full of rage. I talk to him calm but he goes off his head saying I need to snap out of my anxiety and the doctors can’t help me or the tablets I need a boot up the arse. Like who says that I’m sick of him.
