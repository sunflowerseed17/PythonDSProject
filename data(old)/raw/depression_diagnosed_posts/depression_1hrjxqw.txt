I cant escape myself. Being me reminds me of the movie "Jhonny got his gun" in which a man is blind, deaf, no arms, and no legs, though doctors are keeping him alive and awake for some reason. I am not in that situation, but for some reason it feels that way, like I'm a zombie on autopilot everyday with a little me in my mind screaming at myself to leave this hell. Benzos and opiates give me a temporary control though, so I eat enough of those to kill 10 men daily. I don't know, reading over this makes me sound so out of touch which I guess I am. Why am I still here?
