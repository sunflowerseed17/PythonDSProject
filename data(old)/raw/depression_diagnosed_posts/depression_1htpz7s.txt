Happy to hear differing perspectives or thoughts from those who are dealing with/have dealt with the same thing, but I’m mainly just posting to get it out.

The world is such a hateful place. I’m 19 and maybe my eyes haven’t always been open to this, but to me it feels like it’s just growing around the world and there’s nothing I can do about it. It feels more and more like for the rest of the world the default position towards others is hatred rather than love.

I don’t think I’m built for the life that I’m meant to lead on this planet. Working just to survive and then slowly becoming weak and dying doesn’t sound like my cup of tea.

I’m at university (meant to be the time of my life), and have great friends and family that are a genuine support system. I’m incredibly grateful for this, I know that a lot of people don’t have this. But in reality they can only really serve as a small plaster on a much bigger wound. They are just as powerless to the issues facing myself and the rest of the world as I am.

I studied psychology in school and I was taught that depressed people have a warped worldview and low self-esteem, but my issues feel so much more personal because they are based on my worldview which frankly doesn’t feel warped at all, and I’m sure a great many people would agree with me were we to have a more in-depth discussion because I’m not a particularly controversial person.

I feel that I’ve been taught I need to be grateful for what I do have, but I can’t help but think about what so many others don’t have, and how I’m not in a position to make the world a better place in any significant way.

Thanks for reading if you did, I just wanted to anonymously vent this to real people.
