I am 25M, single

Been feeling very depressed for the last few years. Despite having a seemingly good life - physical health, wealthy family, stable role in the family business and good set of friends,  I am not in the place I want to be. My narcissistic and controlling parents also won't allow me to do anything else other than what they want me to do and often impose all their opinions, beliefs and insecurities on me. Its like I feel suffocated in my own home as I have never been emotionally close to them due to my words and feelings being treated like trash. My workplace environment isn't also really good either. It's just a few friends that are probably the only silver linings of my life. It's also hard for me to leave due to my filial responsibilities, else I would've moved to my college city, where many opportunities exist as well for me. If I share this with my family, they would harp about how ungrateful and cowardly I am for not taking on these challenges. I dont mind other challenges but not these challenges.

I can carry out my daily tasks quite well, but with quite a bit of effort, and unfortunately not with the standards and efficiency that I am hoping for. I also make good money on my merit and have contributed significantly to the family business. Yet it pains me when people praise me or tell me they would love to be in my position as I myself really hate where I am in. I feel exhausted when I wake up and long for just those few hours of lone time and bed rotting before I sleep. I also daydream and fantasize a lot about being in a different situation than I currently am in. Have contemplated taking my life a few times.

I really dont know what to do as I feel stuck
