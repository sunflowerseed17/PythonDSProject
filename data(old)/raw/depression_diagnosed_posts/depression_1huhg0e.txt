I can't continue to live like this but I don't want to die like this. -- I've seen some folks who struggle with severe depression who said "It gets better. I nearly killed myself and now I am so glad I didn't!" but I don't know how overcome like they did.  
  
Honestly, I don't believe that I can ever get better or that IT gets better but I have to try as it's do or die at this point. Every day I slide one thought closer to suicide and with the New Year, the weight of failure is just getting heavier and heavier. 

Are any of you one of those "post-depression folks" or know someone who is? What did you/they do? I honestly don't know where to start. I went to a psychiatrist a couple years ago when I dropped out of college due to depression. I was on some medication for about 8 months that just made me completely incapable of experiencing any type of emotion. My entire life was gray and I was indifferent. I felt no love, joy, laughter, pain... I was just indifferent. It was almost as bad as the depression spirals that it was trying to keep from in the first place. I stopped because my psychiatrist left her job and failed to hand me off to another doctor and they made me "re-screen" with a new doctor before renewing my prescription. An appointment they scheduled for weeks after I would have run out of pills. So I was forced to cut off cold turkey. Suffice it to say, I am little gun-shy of medications and physiatrists but I know that may have just been a bad experience. -- Should I pursuit medication again but something else? Or should I start elsewhere?
