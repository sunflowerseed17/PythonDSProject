i spent new years with family but then they all went to bed like very early and i drank until i blacked out , dont remember how did i get in bed and apparently i fell aswell, i dont want to be like this but the feeling of loneliness is so brutal, im stuck i cant get a job because my mind is always telling me awful shit, and i think other people laugh at me and look at me like im a fking wierdo, and i mean i probably am now i can sleep because i slept all day and started crying , i dont want to break my family's heart specially my grandmom, i miss my ex so badly i ended up with her because i was scared that she was going to cheat on me because she always was seeking for attention on social media and sometimes i saw that she was chatting with some guys, until one day she when on a date (she told me that it wasnt a date btw, but she went to a restaurant had a beer even a joint with some guy that speaked to her in her social media) AND i breaked up with her because i know she was going to cheat on me some day i could feel it and that i took it like the last sign , but now, i want to talk to her so bad, i miss her so much but she probably was going to cheat because im a fucking looser i cant maintain a fucking job im constantly scared for no reason, paranoid, i dont think im squitzo because i dont hallucinate (i think) so she finished her studies we lived toghether i just stayed at home im a looser thats why she wont comeback even if i do the dumbest thing and speak to her again, and if we comeback she will cheat on me because im a looser anyway, their family thinks im a fucking looser ass weirdo aswell, but at some point she loved me i loved her and maybe i fucked everything for nothing? like my whole life i fucked my brain with weed alcohol, even coke sometimes, i might fucking need anti-psychotics but they are god fucking awful right? u cant even stay fucking awake with thoose, my dad thinks i would never be someone and i think he is right i think the fking awfull people that looks at you and laughs and say shit to me is right there is no  point on keep trying right i mean what a mess i ruined everything i was a happy boy even when people did or say mean shit to me i didnt care and i lost all confidence at like 20yrsold now im gonna be 30 this month and nothing changes i cant change i think its over im done, but i cant end my self because i love my family so much i dont want to hurt them im a huge problem i feel like im breaking their heart anyways just slowly god i miss her so much i acted like a fool all the time to make her laugh how could she see other guys she fucked me up more than i already was i cant..
