For the last I'd say 3-4 yrs I've lost a will to live or find any meaning in life. Losing my family was hard enough over those years I lost more than half my immediate family that I was close with, as time passes on, I find myself still unable to cope after their loses. 

Recently my partner of a long time lost his grandfather. Almost every day if something happens it's exploding into my fave that I'm the issue. He yells at me, tells me I'm selfish I don't listen and basically I feel terrible. This is not this first time we've had arguments but when something as small as a haircut upsets him he explodes and the only person in the way to take it is me. 

Every time these happen I just think back to my now gone family and want to be closer and wish I was with them or maybe just even eternal sleeping so I wouldn't have to feel like a piece of useless shit all the time.

I don't have a lot of friends, I'm not good or can't seem to keep them so I never know where to turn or speak to. I doubt I'll amount to anything and I'll probably lose my job like I do my others in time because....I'm just not good enough for it. The only reason for me staying here is because my parents, I don't want more pain on them, but more and more I just feel isolated from everything, everyone. Everyday feels like a pain that isn't getting better and I just feel hopeless.
