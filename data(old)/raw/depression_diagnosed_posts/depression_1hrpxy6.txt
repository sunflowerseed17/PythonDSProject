i dont know how to feel.

i planned to kill myself when i was 16 but i didnt go through with it… i ended up completely giving up on myself when covid hit and i had to complete my senior year through online classes… i didnt try on the SAT because i truly never planned to get this old and now im slumped.

i have no motivation for living but i don’t want to die… but i don’t want to live anymore… im so lost and i know people say im still so young but i truly believe this is it for me. this is all life will be.

i want to have a family of my own one day but i can’t see that ever happening and i just feel like a floating corpse everyday… i don’t know what happiness feels like and i have decided to just accept that i’ll die alone… and i mean it when i say it is the most gut wrenching thing to come to terms with.

i’m not excited to turn 22. this is just another reminder that i should’ve been fertilizing the planet by now… instead i am wasting space that could’ve been occupied by someone who isn’t useless.

this is just a vent post.

i’m supposed to work a closing shift on my birthday but im going to call out and go watch nosferatu by myself. happy 22nd.
