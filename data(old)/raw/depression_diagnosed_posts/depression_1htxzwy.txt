I have tried for so long to find something to live for, something to enjoy, something that can keep me here on this earth. It just seems like there's nothing out there for me after 27 years of life. I take medication, go to therapy, and try my hardest to be positive and change, but nothing works. A part of me doesn't really want to die, but I don't really want to live either. I literally only live for my mom and my cat, but they are both getting older, and once they are gone I doubt there's much use sticking around. I just want something to live for, but everything just seems so bleak and not worth it in the end. I want to just go to sleep and never wake up again. Despite having nothing to live for, there are so many things I want in life, but I know that I will never achieve any of them, at this point they are unattainable and just dreams. I feel like something is wrong with me. I care so much, but at the same time I am indifferent.  I feel so much yet feel so little. I am just tired of this battle and I don't know if I can do it for the next 50+ years. I have already dealt with this depression for 15 years, and it's hard imagining even 15 years more. I just want to be happy.
