This has been a recent problem that my friends have partially pointed out to me. We were standing in line for an event i wanted to go to a year or so ago and originally i would have gone by myself but it turned out they wanted to go to. I mention this because when I was at the event in line I felt okay but not excited. None of the joy that came with an event i really wanted to go to. And my friend was looking at me expectantly. 

That was a while ago and it really bothered me. I re-examine a lot of my life and find that there’s a limit to how much joy i feel out of something. I can still be happy and I still have my hobbies but it feels like there’s a cap. I guess I’m making this to find other people who feel the same
