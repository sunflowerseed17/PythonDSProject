Hi guys!


I recently found out my friend has seasonal depression, although I have only known them for 6 months, I am still in the get to know them phase. However despite knowing them in that short amount of time, I still want them to know that I am there for them and am willing to show up for them. They are very unresponsive on the phone and over text (like they won’t pick up or answer) they weren’t like that before. I really need to get creative with how I can get to them. I am like the opposite of seasonal depression, I need communication.
