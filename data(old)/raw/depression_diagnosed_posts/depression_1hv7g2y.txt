In the past, I've told myself that I don't owe her anything because I didn't ask to be born, but when I think about it some more, I feel ashamed of myself for being a disappointment. She deserved better than what she got. She made all those sacrifices only for me to amount to nothing. The parents around her had kids who were winning medals at science fairs while I could barely get out of bed in the morning. I was pathetic then and I'm still pathetic now, except that I'm a late bloomer in life struggling to catch up with everyone else who left me behind. 

I ruined her life by being born. She stayed married to my lazy deadbeat dad because I was attached to him while he mooched off her and gambled away her savings later in life. She could've done so much more with her life if I hadn't been born, and if I hadn't shackled her to my father.

I'm an embarrassment. I wish I would have been a stillborn like my younger brother.
