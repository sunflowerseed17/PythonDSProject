sorry im new to the subreddit but i wanted to discuss my feelings because i don't really have anywhere else to i guess.

my psychiatrist always tells me that me taking antidepressants is so that i don't 'overreact' to negative situations and so i can handle them better. i don't know why but it just makes me feel like im the abnormal one and that it's not the often abusive/unstable situations im put into but that its me, that i have to change so i just take it. i know it's not what they mean but it really makes me feel that way.

not to mention my dad who takes me to the psychiatrist is probably the least understanding. all he does is inquire about my meds and when the psychiatrist asks how i seem, every time he says that I'm fine. like of course i am because every time i express any sort of frustration or anger or sadness he just shuts it down and asks if ive taken my meds like I'm a patient in a ward. I'm so sick of him and everyone else who's 'treating me' acting like im the one at fault and that I'm to blame for my issues and how im the one who needs to be fixed with these stupid meds.

Anyways sorry to rant. I'm living in Japan and mental health is treated like a joke here.
