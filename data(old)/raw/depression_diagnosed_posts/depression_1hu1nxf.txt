Can anyone help me? About 2 months ago around October 24 I went to target looking for a buildable closet for my room, the first target I saw someone I knew which kinda made me nervous but I didn’t think much of it but I couldn’t find the item and left. I went to another target and saw another person I knew and got nervous but I found the item I needed and left. As I started to leave the parking lot I noticed that I started to feel weird on the way home I felt different I tried to ignore and play some games with my brother but the feeling was strong. My brother ordered mc Donald’s and I went to eat until I noticed I wasn’t hungry anymore like my appetite was cut short so I went upstairs to my room and started crying the feeling was so overwhelming I didn’t know what I was feeling but it was not me this led me to be in a depressive state that I’m still in but it’s not as bad from when it started but I’m just so confused what happened that day to cause all of this could this be a hormone imbalance I’m 16 and a male none of my parents really had any mental issues besides my mom with anxiety can someone help me thanks.
