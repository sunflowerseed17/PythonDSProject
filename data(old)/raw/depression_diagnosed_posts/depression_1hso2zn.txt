Everything was looking up in 2024.
 I had completed my UK degree in Law with a first and went on a solo trip to Jamaica. I then went to abroad for the summer and then on my return was diagnosed with Trigeminal neuralgia. I already suffer with Anxiety, Idiopathic Intracranial hypertension, Tinnitus and Hidradenitis suppurativa.

Shortly after my nan died unexpectedly and I couldn't pull myself together to go do my LPC masters in Law. I am grieving so badly, I didn't know it would affect me so bad. 

That's when the hopelessness settled in. I'm guessing the time of year isn't good either.

My ex makes co-parenting difficult as he is/was abusive and every opportunity makes me feel bad about myself. I have even considered giving  up custody to not have him in my life 

My boyfriend is has an avoidant attachment style so he is hard to show love and emotionally unavailable at times but he's a good role model for my child and he's a good man overall.

Now I am so depressed and low. I cannot stop crying, to the point where I am being  sick, I am idle. I dont know what to do with myself whether it's work, what job do I do? - I was trying to become a solicitor and the only route now is SQE so I let that go. 

We were trying for a baby the last 6m hasnt worked then I was diagnosed with Fibroids.
 
I can't take another blow then I broke up with my boyfriend on New years day.

I am so over life. I just feel ungrateful for still being here when I don't want to be.
I feel I let go of too many things in the last four months and I will not overcome it. 

I didn't want to go on medication the GP prescribed Sertraline.
