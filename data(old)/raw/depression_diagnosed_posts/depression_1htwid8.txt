I don't want to. But it just feels like there's no other option. I feel so hopeless and alone. It's been almost 2 years since I've had a conversation with someone that lasted longer than 5 mins. Last time I had an meaningful physical touch(like a hug) was my senior year in highschool. Which was 9 years ago. I have such a deep sense of dispare in my chest. I thought I would end up better than birth circumstances. Better than my mother who died of alcoholism at the age of 43. Better than my father who was jailed for raping my 5 year old sister before I was old enough to even know him. But turns out I was wrong. Cause in the end, they still had people who loved them. And still do for my father. The only times my chest isn't gripped by the a suffocating blanket of anxiety, is when I imagine my death. I imagine what it would feel like for a bullet to go through my brain. Or to simply bleed out. I imagine bleeding out would be pretty euphoric. I really need to man up and get on with it.
