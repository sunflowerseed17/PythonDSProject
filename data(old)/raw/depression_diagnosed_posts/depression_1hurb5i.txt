I (18M) don’t know what to do with my life. I always feel like shit, I have a bad relationship with my family and I don’t have any enjoyment in life. I’ve had an eating disorder for the past 2 years and barely eat a meal a day nowadays. I’ve always been a bit chubby and my mother always put me down because of it. When I was a child she used to say that she was going to start buying bras for me and even nowadays she says “look at the belly on you” and “you need to start going to the gym” and she doesn’t understand that I can’t help that. I’ve been struggling with depression for about 2 and a half years now with it getting better than worse. The only thing that’s stopping me is how my friends would feel and my girlfriend and my dog that I share a room with would see my dead body. I don’t want to inflict that pain on others just myself. I’ve lost the feeling of love, I don’t feel love for my friends, I don’t feel love for my girlfriend but I enjoy being around them most the time. I feel slightly better with them but that doesn’t last long. As soon as I’m alone it all comes flooding back, the suicidal thoughts, the sadness, the numbness. I just want it all to stop. I would give everything in the world for me to just disappear and nobody remember me. Sometimes I just feel like I’m just a burden everyone has to deal with and it’d be better for me to be 6 feet under. I’ve always struggled with talking to people and have social anxiety which doesn’t help. I wish I was never born. I wish I never met anyone. I wish I never fell in love with that girl that ruined my mental health.
