i recently got diagnosed with major depressive disorder,ive had it for as long as i can remember im 29 now. i really try my best to stop complaining but it feels like my brain is telling me i have to. it’s affecting myself and people around me. i feel very weak and it often feels like something is controlling me. my brain feels like its hardwired to complain or be negative no matter how much i fight it. i don’t know what to do, im afraid to talk using my voice cus more often than not i know nothing good will come out of it and i don’t want to lose anyone else due to it. hard to be strong sometimes when as a man thats all u want to be. it feels like im possessed sometimes i hate it. and what makes it worse that its so hard to shut my mouth as well
