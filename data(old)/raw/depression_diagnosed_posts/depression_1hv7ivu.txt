2 months ago I created a tinder account,  I was on it for about 45mins  to an hour, I didnt necessarily cheat but I am a grown men I know right from wrong.... she found out she said she needed to process everything, around  mid November she just started giving me the silent treatment, I also head that her brother has been in the hospital so I'm sure that played a big part as well, we have a place together but I left the house that week that  cheated making a tinder but I did let her take her space at our home, it's January I'm still paying everything  but I still haven't been able to move back in, I'm pretty sure she's just ghosting me out till the lease runs out in March..... at this point, my brother just passed away during all of this.... and my uncle found out he had colon cancer within the same 2 months..... I feel like my life has gone down hill since I made that tinder, I fought with myself the entire time...I made a bad decision and I literally lost my entire life, I even payed to help her open a nail shop not to far from our home, now im sleeping on a couch at my moms... starting completely back over again.....if you been through this how did you pick yourself back up?
