I feel like the worst feeling and most disheartening one when dealing with my depression is when the issues that troubled me and i somehow managed to forgot about it or dealed with it in my own way come back to haunt me, be it my sexuality, how i view the world, my objectives, every single issue i had in the past and came to an agreement with myself somehow, suddenly come back to haunt me and somehow show that in more than 10 years dealing with this fucking illness that plague my life i didn't had a single bit of progress.

I'm still that same kid that looked the mom in the eyes and asked her to explain what happiness was, the same kid that didn't know how to see the difference between man and woman, between a human and a dog, the same kid who hurt herself when her dog died just to cry because she couldn't feel sad for the death of something she took care for years and the same idiot that still think something inside them is not working properly.

I thought i was okay with myself and the way i am, but maybe it was a lie, i kept going forward, studying, looking for a job because i wanted to save for something big but fuck, i don't even Care for money, i spend most of my salary buying things for others than for myself because i can't feel any desire to buy something new, i bought the PC i dreamed when i was a child, thinking of playing games at the best config and play online and all i do with it is look at wallpapers, play the PVE of Teamfight tatics alone, read novels and try to write my own, i had girlfriends and broke up with all of them due to the most random things, i tried men to see if i was gay or some shit that could explain my disinterest and the same happened.

Sometimes i feel like i'm touching the world using gloves the entire time, my emotions feel so little and meaningless that i doubt if they exist, the only strong feeling i have is the weight around my heart dragging me down and the stress of faking too much for too long.
