i feel like i am dying. there is no different way to word how i feel other than that. my body is shutting down and i feel it every single day i am alive. i am in pain i ache physically and mentally but i am forced to stay alive. i thought that no matter what, i would always have myself. in my loneliest moments, when i wanted comfort, when i needed someone to look after me i would always be there but i am not there anymore. even my own mind has turned against me but the world just keeps on spinning. it slows down for no one i see that now. i have lived like this for my whole life, 15 years on end. since i was a kid. now for many people that doesn't seem like a long time, but my body is ready. my mind is ready. i am ready. i would like to rest now, to be held in my mothers arms like i am a child again i am grieving something i never had and will probably die without.
