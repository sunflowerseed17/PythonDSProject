Another lap and another reflection on what has happened. In the grand scheme of things I am no steps closer to any of lifes major goals and with another year gone they seem even more unreachable than before. Amid a few enjoyable fleeting detours I am no closer to health, love, a home or family. I feel as though the harder I try the worse off I become and contiue to inch closer towards ideas of the end.
After all why continue when all that is formenting is unease and uncertainty to accompany the ever present self doubt.
The tension between blood both mentally and physically are unavoidable and inescapable no matter where I run to.
Try as I may the fog thickening around me obscuring any navigation towards hope or happiness grows darker agitating not only my paths but my mood, dampening what little joys I could be having into miseries.
