I’ve had depression for as long as I can remember.

My childhood was full of abuse and trauma, leading to me being seen by mental health professionals at 8 years old. 

I left school at 11.

At 13 I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. 

At 14, my grandmother died a horrific death in front of me. 

At 15, I re-entered school. There, I met the person who sexually and emotionally abused me. 

At 16, my mum almost died from a brain tumour. 

At 18, my grandfather died a horrible death. I regret not spending more time with him. 

Now, at 19, I’ve dropped out of college 4 times. I work a crappy part time job for minimum wage, barely living. 

A few months ago, I was at the brink of ending my life. The only thing stopping me was my own laziness. 

The only reason I’m alive is because I’m medicated to the point that I can’t feel a thing. 

I’ve purposely stopped taking my meds in order to fuel my eating disorder, as being depressed stops me from eating. 

I truly don’t have anything to live for. 

I don’t want to live working until I eventually die. I don’t want to watch the people I care about pass.

I don’t even know why I’m here.
