Okay I get this is a stupid question to ask in a subreddit about depression, but hear me out. I’m a ninth grader and all i’ve been feeling is just on and off sadness and emptiness. I feel so hollow until something fun happens and it’s like a temporary relief. After that, i’m alone again. I get stuck in my own thoughts and bad memories. Inspecting every little thing that happened to me in a different perspective. I’ve cut and attempted. It’s like nothing feels fulfilling. But, I am happy at times. With friends or others, it’s like nothing happened. Until, I get a glimpse of my own reality. I feel like I’m overreacting and this is just teenage behavior, but i’m not sure. I wish I could stop being this sad.
