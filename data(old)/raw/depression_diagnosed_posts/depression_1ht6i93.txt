I feel like I have fallen so deep into the darkness that there is no way out. Heck, nobody even knows I am here, let alone how deep I am.

How does one find motivation to get back to the light?

On the surface I have the world at my feet. I appear as though I've got it together, I'm everybody's go-to person. I'm a kind, generous human, I appear professional, successful and calm, like nothing in this world could knock me.

Under the surface I am a shell of a human. My debt is beyond anything I can get out of, the cost of living is catching me and I have no source of regular income. My landlord just sold my house and I have only a few weeks to find somewhere new, with no money or motivation. I have been a self-harmer for 22yrs but nobody knows. I've lived with daily thoughts about how to leave this world for almost as long - nobody knows this either. I am worthless, useless, hopeless, weak.

6mths ago I decided to do something thinking I was at my lowest amd ended up on medication; I'm now on the highest dose, I feel no different. Great, I fail at this too. I can't afford ongoing intensive therapy, instead sticking with my current counsellor who is trying her hardest but knows I need more. She has even mentioned voluntary admission.

I have no motivation to get better anymore, and no money if I even wanted to try. My thoughts have worn me so thin that I have no energy, desire, hope to get better. People say it gets better, but it's been 22yrs. My brain has been altered by grief, and because I allowed my illness to go untreated for too long. My brain has been changed in ways I cannot undo, and I feel like the only way forward is to find life's exit.
