I am writing this post to give my thoughts a place to live and to also seek advice and support in the community. Any and all help will be appreciated. 

I am 24F and I have had occasional bouts with mental health for a couple of years now.

For the past 2-3 weeks, I have just been feeling very overwhelmed. I don’t feel like doing anything and everyday just feels like a drag.

I avoid all social interactions and am isolating myself completely from most people around me. I start crying randomly through the day (has been happening everyday now for 1.5 weeks), and am getting more and more averse to loud noises and bright lights. 

Nothing makes me feel anything. Not my dog, not my parents, not my hobbies. 

I have this impending feeling of doom and that something is really wrong but I cannot point it out. 

I don’t know what to do and am reaching the absolute end of my wit.
