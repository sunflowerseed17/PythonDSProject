molar crown on my right bottom side break completely off, I only get 3k insurance per year and there is only one dentist in my area who takes hmo insurance and he has bad reviews of being rude to people who are of poverity like myself. 

I am turning 44 this year around the end of the year, lost my mom my dad when I was 23/25 have no siblings no cousins no aunts and no friends. I am completely alone renting a room from an elderly woman who i don't get along with. I live on ssi 930 a month to live on. in a small town with no public transport struggling with severe loneliness, Cptsd, severe chronic depression and severe social anxiety. all diagnosed. I didn't picture my life like this, I pictured I would already been settled down married living in a small town with big town vibes. 

I just don't have it in me anymore. im just so tired of being alone and being treated like I am not worth anything in life and having to deal with stuff constantly coming up like this broken crown, etc... just tired of fighting alone and having no support from anyone other than myself.
