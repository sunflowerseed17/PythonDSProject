those lase two days i have been crying a lot and shaking and having panics attack and convulsing...because of a phobia that i have...the phobia of having and feeling extremes fear of pain, i quit stop myself imaging me burning in a the Islamic version of hell or a Christian version of hell. i was shaking violently 10 minutes ago and sobbing, i hate myself for being that weak, i hate my self for being a coward, i have lost hope of healing and leading a normal happy life...because of my constant phobia, mental illness, intrusive though and obsessions...i just think about killing myself constantly...yet i am so afraid to die...what if there is something after that that will constantly hurt me....like a wrathful god or something...i have a severe hadephobia and religion is making it worse for me....i just want to be happy or die....i want my suffering to stop....i want to stop hurting myself and hurting my mother. i want to stop fearing for the future and become stronger....my mother kinda make it worse sometimes by telling me that i will lose all of my sanity (i am yelling when writing that) my mother always tell me that i will become crazy and be running outside yelling and being mocked upon....she always tell me that i will become utterly insane and mocked up, humiliating in the street, people will be running after me to insult me, mock me and toy with me...she refuse to let me express my emotions...she become mad and sometimes verbally abusive when i cry and yell.
