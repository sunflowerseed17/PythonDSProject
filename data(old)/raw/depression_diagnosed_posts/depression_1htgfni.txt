I don't know what the fuck is happening, I just can't focus at all, I want to vent all out here.
So I am 18m, I cleared my 12th class last year and got admission in Delhi University+ started my preparation for CA foundation, 
Ca in itself is difficult doing along with regular college requires very much sacrifices.
That one subject business law, I hate it so much from bottom of my heart.
Seeing others achieving different different things, participating in different things, just gives me anxiety that I am not able cope up with and also there are many students who are able to manage all the stuff.
Due to this, it has killed motivation within me to study and I just try to find some sought of way to escape the reality through timepass on internet as real world feels tough to me. 
My university exams are also starting from 6th Jan but I definitely know that I am gonna fail.
Sometimes I feel maybe I was born to be failure and I should die.

Please anyone help me to deal with all these stuffs.
