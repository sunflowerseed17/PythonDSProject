Currently I am at freshman year at my university. Here we have to sit for entrance test and I literally failed getting into the instituitions I have always targetted. Although my current university is also pretty well-known but I never liked it. Infact I feel suffocated being here. Students at my university are quite proud to study here but I feel like an absolute loser when I walk into the university gate. I feel like I failed myself hence I am here. I recall those false promises by parents who told me that they will send me abroad for higher studies but when it was the time, they literally backstabbed me or kind of blackmailed me. Here at my university, I constantly search for escape, couldn't make any friends, doesn't want to make any friends. Not judging them though my class mates seems quite out of the line to me. They are not the person I think I can get along. I feel absolute void here and feel hopeless. Not gonna lie but I find myself incompatible as well. I had only one friend who also left country last year and I have literally no one to hangout with. I tried to get along with people but it seems like they do not enjoy my companionship that's why I never tried it. Recently, I joined a club so there is no development to tell about since it will be too early to say.
