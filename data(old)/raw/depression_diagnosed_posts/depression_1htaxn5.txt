Because if I died, I don’t think anything would change. Nobody really needs me. They already got what they wanted and bled me until I was dry. I’m broke and struggling and no one cares because I don’t benefit them anymore. So what is my purpose? I’m sure my niece and nephews would miss me but since I don’t see them often I think they’d get over it quickly because they’re kids. My sisters too. I feel like I failed at life. I feel like I have no purpose. I just want to hide away in a hole and lay there forever. What is my purpose? I can’t get a job and I’m a high school dropout. I feel like a loser. I’m behind on my rent and all the people I’ve helped don’t care because I no longer benefit them. I helped them because they really needed it but when I need help I see no one. I’m $13,000 in credit card debt because I was kind enough to let my “family” use them because they were in need but didn’t pay it back. They think it’s just free money. I don’t know how I’m going to be able to pay it if I can’t get a job. I’d rather give up. I don’t want to be here sometimes. I don’t know what to do. This stupid “disease” stops me from doing anything out of embarrassment and anxiety. I hate it. I feel like I’m looked down upon.  It just feeds my depression. I can’t even go to a store by myself without bringing one of the kids with me because I’m scared. What is my purpose? I’m rotting from the inside. They think it’s just because I’m lazy. I’m just scared. I don’t like living like this. I want to be normal. I can’t. I wanna give up. I’m really tired. I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel lost. I’m scared because there’s nothing for me out there. But I have too much pride to tell anyone. They think I’m fine.
