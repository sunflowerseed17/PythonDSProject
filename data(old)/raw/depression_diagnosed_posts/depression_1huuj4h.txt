My constant search for a real emotional connection with someone puts me in a pit of expectations that drowns me in deep sadness. This is a complicated world, with people becoming increasingly complicated and superficial. You become prey surrounded by lions all the time. 

That's how I've been feeling, weak in the face of expectations that someone will care about me on such a deep level that I want to care about them. I've always been like this, since I was a child. always looking for a connection with someone and ending up disappointed. Without this immeasurable desire for love I would be invincible, but I am a victim of my own nature and emotions, and this is the strongest of all. It is a double-edged sword, it gives me hope and causes me pain.

The world turning its back on our most basic needs is a tale older than time itself, and anger is the easiest response. I'm sad, disappointed, but strangely at peace at the same time. I can't change this about myself, but I can try to keep it somewhere in my heart indefinitely. There is no paradise for you to escape to, and everything around us is a constant battle, and if I'm still standing here, maybe I'm getting good at enduring it.

And of course, good things can still be found in the little things.
