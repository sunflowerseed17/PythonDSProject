So I have been struggling with depression and at first it just made me feel sad and unmotivated to do anything but lately I've been feeling annoyed at everyone and everything they do I take it as a personal attack and now it cost me my only friend, I know I had been shitty and I tried to apologize and they said that it was okay and that they understood but now they blocked me and they said that me being negative all the time was overwhelming and I'm like well I'm sorry I can't turn off my depression for you even if I wanted, and now I don't know what to do because I can't make new friends and everything just seems too shitty now and I miss them and I wish I could just change how I acted and still be able to talk to them
