A little background - I am triple negative, stage 3, and have been through two blocks of chemo on the iSpy 2.0 trial (Block A- Enhertu/immunotherapy, then Block B- Taxol/Carbo/Keytruda).  Since the end of Block A, my initial tumor (2.0 tumor with non mass enhancement extending to 6 cm) has shown a “complete imaging response” and the one biopsied positive lymph node has decreased in size to 6 mm but still looks “iffy”.  There are still abnormal looking lymph nodes in my right axilla (tumor side) that they have been monitoring to decide whether I go to final block C of chemo (AC) or straight to surgery.  

I talked to oncologist today and they took my case to tumor board and basically were all perplexed why right lymph nodes haven’t had same response as the tumor since end of block A (although the biopsied positive one did decrease in size). Then they went back through all my imaging and saw that my lymph nodes on my right side now match the ones on the left side and they all look “shoddy”  (and left side has looked the same since the beginning), so they think I might just have inflammation in my LN generally and that’s my normal anatomy, if that makes sense.  But they want to do biopsy of both right and left to rule out cancer and if negative then surgery in 5 weeks.

Has anyone had abnormal lymph nodes on imaging that turned out benign and were just a result of inflammation or something else?
