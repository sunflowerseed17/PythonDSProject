I just starting my first week off kisqali. I was not informed by my Oncologists office I have to make an appointment to come in monthly for the shot. There seems to be a lot of confusion with them. They are now saying they are short staffed and my Zoladex shot will have to be pushed back one week and this is not clinically significant. I know this may seem like a small thing but I googled it and it seems waiting a week when it is due does matter. I was curious if anyone has had this happen. A nurse drew a little calendar out for me when I started to know my off week and when I get bloodwork and the shot. So now Iâ€™m confused as to whether I wait to restart my next 3 week cycle or start a week later. This is a recurrence and a new oncologist office and I feel like my old one would have just fit me in. There was definitely a lack of communication because I had to call and ask multiple times to even get this delayed appointment for the shot. When I met the nurse who explained the protocol and treatment to me it seemed they scheduled the appointments. Does anyone have any experience with delaying the ovarian suppression shots? 
Thanks
