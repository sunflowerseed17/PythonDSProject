Hello. 👋🏾 I have been lurking here for a while, grateful for the community cause it has helped me a lot. Back in October 2024, I was diagnosed with IDC Stage 1A, Grade 3, ER and PR +, HER2-.  I had a partial mastectomy, breast reduction and lift to both breasts December 10th. I was told I achieved clear margins, and my lymph nodes were negative for any disease. Waiting on my mammoprint to determine if chemo is needed and soon I will have to do 15 sessions of radiation, followed by meds for 10 years. 
So my question is, 4 weeks post surgery, I’m feeling a lot of swelling and what sometimes feel like the same lump is back. Is it normal to have swelling where the tumor once was? I’m freaking out thinking that I’m already having a recurrence.
