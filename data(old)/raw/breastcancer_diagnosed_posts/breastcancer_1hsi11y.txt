I was diagnosed with IDC, ER/PR+, HER2-, grade 2, Stage II nearly a month ago and am waiting for a surgery date (hopefully at the end of the month 🙏)

The results of my genetic testing came through the week before Christmas and I tested positive for the BRCA2 gene mutation. 

(My first appointment after diagnosis was an MRI, second was with a genetic counselor, followed by the breast surgeon and oncologist… plastic surgeon, later today)

Dramatic and surprising news for my family. Zero bc history in the fam before now—massive sample size on mom’s side, minuscule sample set on dad's… so we think it came from dad, my parents and 4 siblings getting tested

My first thoughts were, “Woohoo! My surgical decisions have been decided for me!” and “Thank god we know this now for my family.” and “I have to tell my sister. Right. Now.” 

I wasn’t upset by this news, just surprised and grateful to know for my family—I have 4 younger siblings, including a sister in her early 40s and a niece and nephews. My paternal cousins have daughters and sons…

I know that in the near future, I will likely decide on surgery to remove my ovaries and fallopian tubes. For me, this won’t be a difficult decision—I am I my mid 40s and have known for years that I don’t want children. I’m also mostly blocking out this future ordeal which seems minor right now compared to my current diagnosis and upcoming treatment. 

I have been wondering about others’ experiences of being surprised by testing positive for BRCA. How might this impact my diagnosis and treatment (other than opting for a DMX which I was fairly sure I wanted anyway)? Any advice for questions for my genetic counselor and oncologist when we meet next week?
