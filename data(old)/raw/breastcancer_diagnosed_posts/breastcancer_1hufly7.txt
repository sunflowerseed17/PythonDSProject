I am 5 days out of SMX with axillary lymph node dissection. I am having this intense itching with pins and needles sensation especially under my arm. It's a sensory overload and it's making the hair on my arms raise. I don't even know how to explain the feeling. Sometimes I also feel a tugging sensation. Any tips to relieve it or make it more bearable? Will antihistamines (Zyrtec) help?
