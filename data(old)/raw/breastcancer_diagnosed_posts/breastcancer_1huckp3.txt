Hi new friends!!  I've been lurking here for a few weeks while I waited on my diagnosis and now that I have it, let me introduce myself.  I am 42F, married with a 19 year old boy and a 13 year old girl.  My routine mammogram back in November just caught the corner of a spiculated mass in my right boob.   It's literally at 3:00 next to the breast and more towards my sternum so who knows how long it has been there since mammograms don't usually scan that far in. Of course shit like this always happens around the holidays/end of year when people met their deductible so it was so frigging hard and time consuming to get in to get my additional imaging and biopsy.  I finally got the biopsy last Friday and January 2nd the results were on the portal.  Grade 2 IDC and it looks to be ++/neutral but also ki67 of 30-40% so it's pretty aggressive.   I meet the surgeon at the end of the month and I have an mri next week.  Thank goodness things are finally moving fast! 

 Now, are any of you self employed/sole proprietor?  I have a salon suite and I literally work for myself, by myself so that means no PTO, sick leave etc (my boss sucks lol).  I do nails so my clients come every 2-4 weeks so time off will be nearly impossible but I also have to pay the salon rent plus the bills at home.  Are/have any of you in the same situation and maybe have some input on how you managed work and cancer?  It's sad that is the part I'm most worried about and I wish I worked a "real" job sometimes. I do have critical illness coverage through my husband's employer that I am hoping will cover cancer.
