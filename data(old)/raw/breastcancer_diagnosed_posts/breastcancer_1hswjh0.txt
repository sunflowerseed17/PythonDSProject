I just checked for the results of yesterday’s all day testing- my whole-body bone scan has “focal activity in several areas (they are listed individually including but not limited to my skull) concerning for osseous metastases. 
I know what that means. 
Cancer is already not good- cancer that has spread to your bones… 

Is there any situation where this isn’t as bad as it seems?  I was just diagnosed with triple-negative BC w/lymph node involvement a week ago.  I guess there’s a reason they’ve been ordering STAT testing of every variety.  Is this survivable?  I’m sitting at work listening to people talk normally about weekend plans and I feel like the ground has fallen out from under me…
