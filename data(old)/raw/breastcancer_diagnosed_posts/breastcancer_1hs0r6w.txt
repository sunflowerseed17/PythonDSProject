Has anyone with a low tumor mutation burden opted to discontinue Keytruda? So I didn't know before, but learned after doing the first leg of Keynote that I have an incredibly low tumor mutation burden. Pembro (Keytruda) is really effective for people with a high mutation burden, but not so effective when the mutation burden is low. I learned that my mutation burden is something like 0.0--- which basically means that my cancer cells are super stealthy lol and end up looking almost identical to my normal cells. Pembro is great for when your tumor cells have a high mutation burden because it says--- hey those don't look like our regular cells. Essentially making it not really that effective in people like me. All this to say, I think I'm just exhausted. I have been getting more tired/fatigued lately and I'm thinking why am I still on this med with so little evidence? I did not get PCR and I'm on Xeloda until Paril. Ugh--- idk. Anyone else in a similar sitch?
