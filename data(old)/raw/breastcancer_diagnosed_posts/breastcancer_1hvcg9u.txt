Diagnosed a few weeks ago with idc.  4 cm.  Cat 1 - stage 1.   Hers +.   Age 65. Met with the surgeon today & was recommended lumpectomy.   She said I could do breast reconstruction & lift on both @ same time which would be nice since my girls have been heading south for a while - the joys of getting old.   Doctor said I have the most treatable form of this and for that I am grateful. Friends of mine suggested I do full mastectomy & reconstruction since I would love  a new set ðŸ˜Š - admittedly none of my friends are doctors & in fact Iâ€™m the 1st of our bunch to be diagnosed with cancer.  Awaiting genetics testing but assuming I have no genetic issues - is double mastectomy & reconstruction going overboard?      Havenâ€™t discussed yet with surgeon & I will but would love to hear thoughts from those who have been through this.
