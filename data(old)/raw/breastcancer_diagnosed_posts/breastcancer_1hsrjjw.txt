First week of November I took an OxyContin when I meant to take a Vicodin.  Ive never had this happen and I was legit insane while still in the hospital.  I had no idea what happened to me.  I couldn’t even see well enough to read my eyes were so dry.  I’ve been getting better slowly but I keep having dizzy spells.  Anyone have experience with this?  My onc is on holiday break and if I can wait this long to not say anything I can hold it a few more days.
