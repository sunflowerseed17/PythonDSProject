I am capping with Penguin and have lost about half of my hair after 3 rounds of AC. I still have a decent amount left but it is lifeless and dull. I have one more AC and then 12 rounds of Taxol. I’ve seen many comments saying that despite losing a large amount of hair, people keep capping to protect the follicles and to avoid permanent loss. My oncologist says that permanent hair loss is rare.   
I’ve searched and cannot find any science supporting capping when almost bald. The only information I find is from the capping companies. Any ideas on where to find the data If it actually exists?
