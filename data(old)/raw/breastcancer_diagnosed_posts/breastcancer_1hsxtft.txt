Hi, just wanting to have a little vent to people who understand…not posted here before but have found a lot of comfort from this sub so thank you. 

I am 41, diagnosed in Sept 2024 with +++. I’ve done 12 THP and am now awaiting surgery in two weeks to see if I need AC + Kadcyla or more Phesgo. I’ve coped ok with treatment so far but my main struggle has been with anxiety and depression.

I’ve been much better recently, psychologically speaking (I was a mess the first month after diagnosis) but this past week and today in particular I’ve taken a real dip and am feeling so overwhelmed. I’ve had to come and lie in a dark room alone because I feel like I’m having a panic attack. I have two young girls (1&7) and and am trying to keep things as normal as possible for them but tonight I am struggling.

I suppose I am just looking for some words of reassurance and encouragement from people who get it. Any tips for coping with everything in particular the waves of anxiety? I’m starting with the gym tomorrow and CBT next week but any other advice is very welcome.
