I'm 2 days away from tchp #5 and thought I was going to get away with no ER visits this round. I've had to go each round for different reasons. I started having burning when urinating yesterday and then my urine looked cloudy this evening, so I knew I had to go and not risk getting urosepsis if it was truly a bladder infection. My urinalysis showed some abnormalities but no bacteria. They're still treating it as an infection just in case but I know this will probably delay treatment. 

I'm getting so frustrated because I just want chemo done! I've already had one delay due to bad blood counts. I haven't worked since chemo started and it's killing me mentally. I'm on disability so I have some income coming in, but I need to work so I can focus on other people for awhile. The side effects have been too detrimental so my MO has kept me out of work. I'm just so angry and frustrated right now.
