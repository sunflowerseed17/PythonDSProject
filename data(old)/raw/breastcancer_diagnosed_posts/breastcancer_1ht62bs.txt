A little over a month ago I was diagnosed with grade 1, triple negative breast cancer. 

2 weeks ago I had a DMX, no cancer in lymph’s and in only one breast, at .7mm

1 week ago I learned they misdiagnosed me, and I’m ER+, PR/HER2-, grade 1, stage 1.  They got all the cancer. No need for chemo or radiation. 

I had a hysterectomy a few years ago before I went into menopause so next week I’m getting a blood test that will tell me if I’m pre/post menopause which will tell the dr which med I’ll be taking to block estrogen. 

So essentially I’m cancer less. But I’m reading that breast cancer can come back. So now I’m scared again, and every little bone pain is making me nervous. I’m trying to keep myself stress free in order to heal, and I want to focus on getting my body healthy (I have 40 pounds to lose), but I’m finding that I’m starting to freak out. 

Maybe it’s cuz it’s been such a whirlwind in just a month…..maybe I’ll not learn to relax now I am linked with cancer…..but how do I know if I have it again? I don’t have boobs, like how in gods name would I know I have breast cancer again?? And how likely is it? If they got it all out, how would it come back ffs? 

My apologies all….it’s evidently my freak out night. Bless you all…..truly.
