on my first watch and on s5 e4 and i’m kinda dying that they’re like “everytime we say anything to hannah she says kyle yells at amanda” and then that’s exactly what happens when they say she isn’t cleaning up after herself. to me, it’s covid…. everyone should pull their own weight and at LEAST clean up their shit and pull their weight it’s kinda childish that they even have to remind her. it does seem like a “hit dog will holler” situation bc hannah flipped her shit and nobody else seemed that upset by the reminder. if i was amanda i agree i chose this piece of shit man and every time you get defensive you come for my relationship i don’t think we’re actually friends. hannah saying amanda doesn’t like her and they aren’t friends seemed to be true i think they should part ways lol. i will say i wasn’t watching super diligently but paige seems to be helping amanda get thru it. anything i’m missing from hannah’s perspective? i’ve had friends with shitty bf before and i wouldn’t take it out on my friend if he said something to me bc it would obviously hurt my friend. i’m trying not to be a hannah hater but she’s making it hard she always thinks she did nothing to contribute to the situation and isn’t very self aware
