I got approached on LinkedIn by a Google recruiter for a SE role. I am excited and freaked out. I can only define my lc skills as mid. Ive solved around 250LC mostly from Neetcode's list mostly medium and ive not solved anything for the past 4 months.

I managed to secure 6 weeks of prep time. Frankly my confidence is low i dont know hows ill prepare, my day job is pretty exhausting. If Anyone who has been through the process can suggest how to prepare I would be extremely greatful.
