I go into a deep depression every Sunday leading into the work week. I love what I do for work, but it's in the way of me chasing my dream(s). I need the money to fund my dream, but I get so emotional every week. When I am sleeping, I am living my real life as my true self. When I am awake, I feel like I'm in a bad dream being a regular person. Maybe I'm closer to monetizing my dream than I think I am and I'm feeling the pressure of it. Idk I just know working a regular job for 40 years is not what I was put on this earth to do.
