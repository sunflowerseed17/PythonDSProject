I am afraid of not being taken seriously because of my education regardless of how much confidence, wealth, or career success I could achieve. The thing is I know I can make it as I have a bunch of ideas that are unique but this thing is getting in the way of me trying my best. I have chronic illness but I have not been diagnosed which makes me feel invalid but I'm in pain in my head 24/7. I've cried 2-4 times a week due to the pain i've had all throughout high school. I had an attempt that caused me to be chronically i'll for 4 years but its hard to get diagnosed since it affected my speech as well. Idk where to go from here. Should I just let all my potential die?
