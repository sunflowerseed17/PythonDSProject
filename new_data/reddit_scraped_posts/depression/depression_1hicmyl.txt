I am 29F. I completed my MBA from a reputed college in 2020 and have been working since then. I joined the social sector as I got interested in public policy during MBA. I currently work as a public policy consultant and my profile is entirely in the social sector. Tbh I was previously very motivated to work in the sector and do better for the society but with time I realised that I am really earning very less even after an MBA. My salary is less than 1 lakh per month while my peers from MBA earn a lot more than me, even some who joined the social sector in monitoring and evaluation, in which I do not have interest or required analytical skills currently. My current organisation is reputed but doesn’t pay well or promote. I am still not even a manager. I feel like a loser and drained, even financially. I am also planning to get married but I feel sad as I am not even able to contribute for my honeymoon. 
I am good at my job and I also want to shift towards knowledge management, grant management and communication roles but I am unable to find anything appropriate and I don’t have explicit work experience in those fields even though I have worked partially in them during my jobs. 
If anyone has any suggestions, please help.
Thank you
