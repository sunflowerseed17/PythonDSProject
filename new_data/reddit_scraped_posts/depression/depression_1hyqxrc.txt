I’ve been struggling with my A-Levels, and things haven’t gone the way I hoped. Back in May/June 2024, I took Maths, Computer Science, and Physics. I got a D in Maths and CS, and an E in Physics. After that, I decided to drop Physics and switched to Business Studies, thinking it might be a better fit. However, when I retook Maths and CS in the Oct/Nov 2024 session, I ended up with E grades in both.

Now, I’ve made the decision to drop out of college and continue as a private candidate so I can focus on improving my grades and nothing else. My plan is to take CS AS Level and BST AS Level papers in May/June 2025. Then in Oct/Nov 2025, I’ll take Maths AS Level and BST A2 Level papers, and finally, Maths A2 Level and CS A2 Level in May/June 2026. My ultimate goal is to get into Habib University in Karachi, which requires at least an overall C in A-Levels with Maths as one of the three subjects.

Some people have suggested that I drop CS and take Urdu instead, but that’s not an option for me because, honestly, I’m terrible at Urdu. I know I’ve struggled, especially in Maths and CS. I’d really appreciate advice on whether this plan is realistic and how I can improve my performance to meet the requirements for university. If anyone has been in a similar situation, your help would mean a lot. Thank you!
