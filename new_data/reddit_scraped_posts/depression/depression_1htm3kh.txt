Phone calls just make me very uncomfortable, I don’t know why. It’s holding me back from getting a job but my therapist is helping me out with it and soon I’ll be in touch with a job coach. 

Talking in person and on video calls are far less uncomfortable for some reason. But phone calls are just ugh. Does anyone else go through this? I literally will just let the phone call end without me answering. It takes effort to answer the phone and talk, and I be nervous.
