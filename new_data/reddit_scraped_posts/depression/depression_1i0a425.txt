I have been feeling depressed for some years now. I have professional support, both psychiatric and psychological.
I am in my last year of university. But I can't seem to get it over with. I am failing all my classes, and it is just so painful to see all my hard work being compromised by my mental and physical health. I want to do something about it, but I don't know what. I feel like if I keep going, it is just going to be a waste of my time... but I don't have a plan B. I feel so useless and unworthy all the time.
My parents give me all the support, and they have told me to take the year off. But I don't want to feel even more useless
