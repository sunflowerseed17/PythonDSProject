I asked them multiple times what my IQ is and they always said average. But yet I consistently scored below average/low average - average in every category they tested me on, even the ones I was best at. 

I know that doesn’t technically count towards your whole IQ. But you can’t tell me I have an average IQ with such low scores, there’s just no way. 

I don’t think they were being honest, I think they were lying to try and spare my feelings. But I’ve been respectful towards them this entire time, I don’t see why I can’t just know the truth. Tell me if I’m dumb or not, I can handle it, and I’d like to know.
