Hello everyone, I'm here to share my story as a story of hope, of how I overcame (and am overcoming) my illness.
Over two years ago now, I got the job of my dreams as a tech team lead in Japan, but when I went there it turned out to be a nightmare- mad long 12 hour days, difficult bureaucracy,ridiculous expectations, and plus the difficulty of managing a relationship with my then partner long distance to Bangkok. It turned south pretty quick, and in the span of 3 months I became heavily insomniac, anxious and very down and thought the only way out was off my balcony in Japan. It was a dark time. But happily I had a manager and team who helped me move back - messily - to Bangkok with steadfast family to support me. I was on like 7 different kinds of medis, in significant debt to my company, and it seemed over many times over. But a year + later I'm happy to say that I built a path forward as a platform operator in SaaS, an admissions coach and (recreationally) swimming, dancing and working out often to beat away the dark clouds. Sadly my partner and I brokeup but that is life. The two jobs keep me decently busy but not overworked, and I've learned that I'm not my thoughts, I can work productively to be engaged, mindful and happy each day, still travel frequently, and hey - I think I am still making more money than I ever have in my life. I'm still struggling with addiction to some degree, I still have brain fog (maybe from the meds) and there are things I regret, but it's the best we can do each day to keep being content and moving onward. Treasure this life - it is the only one you have! And with consistent effort and focusing on small but certain happiness, it can be quite beautiful! Have faith my friends!!
