i just feel choked up i can't sleep i want to vanish, i just want to sleep and not worry about me, i hate being me i fucking hate myself i want to cut myself all over again, i know it hurts my family more than it hurts me, i don't know what to do, i just want to disappear without upsetting anyone, i wish i could stop existing and have my family be ok with it
