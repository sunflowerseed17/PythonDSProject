i feel like i left my heart in my childhood home, before i was able to perceive trauma and the painful emotions that have followed me into adulthood. 

sometimes i dream of that time period, brief moments of peace that i have long since forgotten. when did i  become so numb and indifferent to suffering? this can only be answered by the hooded figures that strike me back into consciousness before i get my answer, and i realize it was all a dream
