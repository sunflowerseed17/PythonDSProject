I'm a 22yo M feeling completely lost in life. Feels like I just failed at everything since I was born. I failed at building up a career, failed at being a good son, a good brother and never been in a relationship. Never got along with people, failed in building meaningful bonds with friends. Never had a gf. I'm currently in a state where I don't seek connections or relationship, women, I'm just dead inside,no feeling, no bond. Nothing....

I've no one to speak my mind out, tell what I actually feel like.Hence, I'm writing this here just to get some weight off...
