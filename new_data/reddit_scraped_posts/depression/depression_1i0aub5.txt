I feel like my mom is dissapointed in my family, including me. I just want to make her happy, but I'm too young and i dont want my mom to be finally happy with me when i grow up and shes gonna be like 60. All i ever wanted was to finally have the feeling of impressing my mom, But I can't. I'm dumb, Short, Fat. I dont feel like my mom will ever be happy. Shes 49 turning 50, And shes been addicted to gambling since she was 48.Whenever she loses, It feels like shes letting out her true feelings. Telling me and this family is useless becauss we can't help her becauss we're not smart, And we cant even give money. I'm trying my best to help. But I'm too young to get money and other sorts of things to help. I wish I was gone because if I was then my mom would have been traveling and living the life. But because of me i ruin it all. She spends all her money on gambling, bills, tuition, and food. Leaving her with barely enough money. I just wanna be atleast smarter, so I can make her a bit happy. I've been praying to God for a while and he responds to my prayers only a day or two after. I can't help but proceed to sin, Especially lust and sloth. I feel like im too useless to everyone to care about. And all I want is for my mom to be happy. I dont enjoy things anymore because when i do it all bites back please help i just dont want to be like this forever.
