In march and october I tried to end myself, but I failed. But I still very much want to die. I have been in the emergency room several times because of this. I only have two friends, but they are the best friends anyone can wish for. After being suicidal and admitted again three weeks ago, they have written me a very loving letter, that they can't watch me anymore and they have to set bounderies. Because of this, they want to cut contact for now. 

I am very happy, that they are honest with me and care for themself. I would never want them to suffer, because I do. I also understand that after 10+ years of supporting me and watching me go from one unhealthy coping skill to the next, they are tried. But still I am so sad and they were the only reason to keep in living. I will never tell them, because I don't want them to feel pressure, but it makes me incredible hopeless. Please give me reasons to keep going and to give back to my Friends, no matter if I live or die. 

Sorry for the long text and my bad english. I am not a native and quite stupid.
