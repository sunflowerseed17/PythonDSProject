me and my dad have smoked cannabis for at least 15 or 16 years and today I bought 7 G, he seems to think that I said that I would split it with him but when I said no I will not split with you he tried to break my hand and kick me out of his house, this was to share just like every single other bit of weed that I have gotten all year and it has left me wondering if my dad is just a junky,,,
