i used to be addicted to benadryl, until it caused me to have severe anxiety, i was looking through my camera roll and saw a night where i was takibg the benadryl, 15 i think, and i thought that night was what caused my anxiety, until i saw that i had also drank like an hour later, i have NO memory of the drinking part, but i threw up after, i guess the alcohol caused my anxiety tho, now im an alcoholic, i just got off xanax, used to drink n then take xans, dont think ill ever stop drinking
