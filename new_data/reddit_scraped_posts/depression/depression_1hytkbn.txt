Hi. I was in a relationship, and it ended abruptly a few months ago. It was my first, and i still am hung up on him (we never spoke again).
I am a very musical person, i sing all the time, and i quote song lyrics that relate to things that are happening (i like to pretend my life is a musical). Because of that, there are a lot of songs that I associate with the times i had with him, or songs that he showed me.
 Now i feel sad everytime i hear those songs (it is a long list of songs), but those are songs i love, and music is a big part of my life. I feel sad because I can't hear them anymore, and I don't know what to do.
