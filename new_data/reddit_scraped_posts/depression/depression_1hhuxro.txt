planning to buy a new macbook air early next year or this christmas mainly for zoom meetings and studying. I just need something light and the battery lasts long since I’m always traveling. would it be wise to buy 8/512 for 1,100 usd or 16/256 gb for 1,015 usd? I do not live in the US so the prices may be slightly higher. Or a base model would suffice? I have a 2tb seagate hard drive but i’m not really sure if it’s compatible with the mba. thanks in advance.
