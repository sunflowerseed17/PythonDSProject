It should be easy since a lot of this stuff is pre made, but a family member gave it to me and i don’t have access to the exact portion sizes or a scale. It’s a burger with ketchup, mayonnaise, and american cheese, knorr cheesy cheddar pasta (online it says a serving is 230 calories), and green giant green bean casserole (on google it says 110 cals per serving). So overall I’m estimating 900? Guessing the burger itself is at least 550. I ate all of it and then a small second serving of the green beans. 

I had 370 calories earlier in the day and my deficit is 1,400 at the moment. Just trying to figure out if i have room for anything else or not.
