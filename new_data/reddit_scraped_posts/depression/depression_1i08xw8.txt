I’m on a healing journey and starting to understand the roots and whys and all of that..  it for years I was just put down so much… my childhood and then my 13 year relationship… I’m frequently so scared what I was told is the truth. It makes it hard to move out of freeze state. I’m starting to understand I’m worthy and I’m not what the others. It me down to be. But it’s so hard to reframe it all..  I’m so scared to fail again.  It’s almost too unbearable to “fail” again…. I know I have to try and I will… just terrified.  It’s weird I hadn’t realized how bad my depression still gets. I have to be better for my daughter…. Just Stuck in the what if I can’t. I always end up burnt out. 

Time to try again… .
