I am 25 and currently a geologist but I’m not so sure it is for me and I’ve been thinking about going back to school and start fresh. I was hoping I could share my interests and maybe I could get some suggestions into careers I may not have ever heard of or things I should look into. 

About me: I am dyslexic so tasks with a lot of reading and writing take me much longer than my peers and are not enjoyable to me. I love math, working with excel, I love innovation and new technology, I like making infographics and slides to help teach others, I like art and photography, I like trying to think of creative solutions to complex problems, I’d like to make higher than $60,000 annually, I like having a work life balance but would sacrifice this if I was doing something I was really passionate about, I like work that feels like I’m giving back or working for the greater good overall, I like teaching others new things, I’d love to start my own business one day or master a skill that would allow me to be my own boss, I enjoy learning new things, I like working with new softwares, I like to see tasks through completion but also to be quick, and I like competition and strategy. 

Hobbies: running, skiing, wildlife photography, music, board games, art, and rollerblading

Let’s hear it! Looking for careers and jobs that I may be a good fit for.
