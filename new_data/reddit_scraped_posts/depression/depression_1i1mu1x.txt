cant believe im actually tyiping this on the internet but im literally out of ways to cope, writing my feelings down is probably the one thing that helped me lately
i am currently in the last year of uni and im afraid ill fail that i wont graduate that ill be looking at everyone my age succes with their studies and with their career while im left behind cus of my stupid life decisions
i have an exam coming up that ive been retaking since first year, im afraid i will fail again then ill have to take a supplementary year just for that subject
its currently 4 am and i cant sleep cus of my thoughts racing through my mind
i had enough of being a burden not only to my friends but especially to my family, i feel like i am not made to live life
