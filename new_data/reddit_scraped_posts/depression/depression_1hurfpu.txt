My bf (26M) and I (25F) have been dating a little over a year. He’s been planning for months and months to quit his job and travel for a while. He’s been gone now for only a little over a week in a 16 hr different time zone and will be gone for almost 50 days total, back for a month, and then gone for 40ish more days. 

I don’t know what to do with myself anymore. We hardly talk other than a couple messages before my bedtime and then me responding to a couple messages first thing in the morning. His days are so busy with exploring that we literally barely talk during the time we are both awake. We’ve had two short phone calls, both felt incredibly awkward and partially one sided (towards his side). I’ve been so fucking bored, I feel like I’m alone, it’s been so frustrating not hearing from him other than travel updates (what he did that day/ate), I don’t entirely know what he’s doing or what his plans are, he goes hours and hours without responding even when I know he’s awake, and I just feel so out of control and disconnected. 

He says he misses me but it’s hard for me to feel any sort of intimacy so I don’t miss him, I’m just overwhelmed by frustration of the situation. 

Please help me feel less alone in this or tell me I’m crazy or what I can do to feel better idk please this sucks so badly.
