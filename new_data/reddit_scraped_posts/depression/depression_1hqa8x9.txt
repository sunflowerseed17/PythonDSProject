The semester has just ended. I received my grades yesterday, which were much better than I could imagine, except for one class that i failed. I barely had any energy the whole semester, and for this class, as its free attendance that you check on the uni portal website, i didn’t attend my classes and just checked the attendances at home. One day, I had my gut saying “they probably aren’t taking attendance today, don’t do it” but there was an open link already, and finally I decided to check the attendance. I check my grades distribution yesterday and find out that on that freaking exact day, my attendance is checked as a misconduct. And I failed that class because of that. And as I failed my classes, a scholarship of mine will be canceled. If i had enough energy, if i liked my uni life, if only i listened to my instincts that day, i would have been spending this new year eve in peace… i hate myself so much… i was getting better. But im even worse. Misconduct? Yes Im a horrible student. I wanna drop out now… i will be broke as heck my next semester without a scholarship… why am i like this…? And now im drown in shame too cuz of that misconduct. Workplace will probably be like this too.. i will underperform and then i will get disappointed in myself.. why live tho? Its full of misery
