Hey everyone,

I had a date last night with a really great woman, and I’m looking for advice on how to follow up after a slightly awkward moment.

We went for drinks at Chili’s and had an amazing time. We clicked over shared interests like anime, gaming, and fitness, and I was really impressed by how smart and accomplished she is—she has her master’s degree!

Everything was going well until she asked me about my dating history. I was honest and told her that while I’ve dated Black women in the past, but most of my dating history has been with taller blonde white women. I am black myself.

I explained that for me, it’s always been about mesh and chemistry rather than race, but I could tell the vibe shifted after that conversation.

I genuinely enjoyed the date and would like to see her again, but I’m unsure how to address that moment. I also want to be intentional moving forward—I do see myself settling down with a Black woman one day, but I’m struggling with the perception of them thinking they are not my “type.”

How should I follow up with her after the date? And for the future, how can I navigate these conversations better so they don’t create tension?

Appreciate any advice or insight!
