19M in a levels I have failed As papers twice in few months I am giving it a third attempt. I have dropped out of high-school, I am going private and taking a gap year. Yesterday I was in high-school to finalise my widrawl and I over shared about my life, medication and issues with parants with so many ppl. Also told a girl I liked her (i have never said this to anyone), she didn't say anything till yesterday (after 3 days) when it was a no. 
Like this is literally rock bottom, all I can think rn is that if life is this bad rn what will happen to me after uni, will I even be able to do somthing with my life and support my parants. Also many of my friends had many if their parants die in last few months so that is also I am extermly afraid of cuz I am extermly financially dependent on then.
Also during o level I was private, and before this it was the worst time of my life, also when my mental health issues started.
Also I am so sick of my medication (I have switched meds around 7 literally cuz none of them suit me) and I have gotten so frustrated that I have been skipping them. 
Then also I have one more fear, what if I start cutting my self again. Also one person in high-school who i barely know found out what was happening excatly (cuz I over shared) he gave me a talk on why its wrong to commit sucide.

I have no idea what to do rn and all my parants are doing rn are forcing me to study which I cant for some reason.
