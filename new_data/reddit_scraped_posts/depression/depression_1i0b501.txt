I am blessed with a lot of friends, some of them are even what you might call close friends.

I can call them up whenever and talk about whatever. I can even vent out my feelings and everything if I wish to, they are quite nice.


I do not feel connected to them though, I don't know if its because of some barrier I have put up myself, but I haven't let anyone, and I mean ANYONE, come REALLY close to me, I do that with the help of some lies. I don't get vulnerable with anyone. I self isolate when I am overwhelmed.


I wonder if I should give up and let someone in, but what if they break my trust?

Plus being vulnerable with someone gives them a kind of power over me which feels like a very dangerous situation doesn't it?
