College is becoming too hard for me to survive . My cgpa is very low , I try so hard still I get low grade. Next year placement are going to start and my cgpa doesn't even clear the selection criteria in most of them.
I feel like crying all day, fear of being judged for performing poorly , I can't face people anymorei tend to overeat or not eat at all.I am uncertain about my future and other's  expectations is making me feel guilty .Idk how to get away from this and will my situation ever better.
