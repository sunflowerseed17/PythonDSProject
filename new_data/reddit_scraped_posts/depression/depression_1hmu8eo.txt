I wish people just looked at me and assumed “yes this dudes definitely single and he’ll stay single”. Why the fuck does anyone have to always ask me my fucking relationship status when they meet me first. It comes from both genders but mostly females. I am tired of answering this, everytime I try to answer it hurts like hell. Fucking 12 years of single hood. Worst part is i don’t think anyone in my circle are even aware that I have been single for that long. Everyone from my relatives to friends just assume that I have a girlfriend and expect a wedding invitation soon. I wish I was the ugliest fuck for them not assume such things and just assume it will be arranged and fixed. I’m tired of this. People should not look at me and have questions whether I am single, they should just be like “yea he’s definitely single and no point in asking him” 

It’s like a limbo, I don’t know what I am. I feel extremely disturbed about myself, abnormal about myself whenever this topic comes up. I’d be better off looking like the guy no one wants to date, rather than being in questionable stasis about my own self image. My confidence just dips down to sub zero. 

I’m not sure I will handle this next year, as in January my sibling is getting married. I am not looking forward to 2025. I am extremely anxious on how I am going tackle all the conversations from relatives on “when are you getting married?”. I am absolutely not ready for it.
