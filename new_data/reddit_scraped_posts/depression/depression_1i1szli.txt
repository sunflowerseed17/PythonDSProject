Hi all, 23 M here. I am done with this life, and i want to end it for myself by committing (you know what). I am unemployed, I am good at studies from childhood. I have a tendency to learn all the things. All my friends whether they are good or bad in academics settled in their lives. Most Important thing is I am **obese**. There is no use, how much i study, I am failing in every interview. don't had any inherited talents or fortune. Relationships none. **Girls treat me like a bug**. Friends also come and interact with me when they need me. I am in depression from past 3 years. There is no place for mental health talk in my family. I don't even know why I am writing this post. So Sayonara Guys. See you on the other side (If it exists)!!!!!
