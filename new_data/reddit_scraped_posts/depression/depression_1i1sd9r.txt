I hate my job, I work a shitty fast food job and balance it with university. My classes are short and most are online, so I work about 30-35 hours. I resent going to work every single shift, yet on my off days I am faced with extreme depression. I feel useless and bored and bedrot for practically the entire day before getting a sudden boost of energy to be productive after hours have past. I don't have many friends outside of work, so most of my socialization outside of my family comes from there. I genuinely hate this feeling but I can't seem to stop myself from doing this.
