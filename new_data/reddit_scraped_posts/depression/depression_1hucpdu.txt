I’m going through a break up that happened in November. We had been together since 2023 and after being so consistent and reliable, he turned around one day and said he had fallen out of love with me for no reason.

We are still in contact everyday because I can’t bear to lose him but I’ve never felt the way I do now. I’m so unhappy every single day.

I started therapy a couple weeks after it happened but I don’t think it’s really helping. I’m a very self aware person so can recognise my own anxious attachment issues etc. but I cannot feel happiness without a romantic connection in my life.

Nothing makes me happy - booking holidays to Paris and New York this year, going shopping etc. everything that would and should bring me joy just makes me feel blank. 

I feel so dull and unhappy every day and it’s making me so so low because I’m not happy living through life everyday. I feel completely alone in this like no one else feels the way I do?
