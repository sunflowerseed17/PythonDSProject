I generally feel like I'm in a neverending spiral of sadness. Not only am I cursed in genetics but I have severe gut issues. I believe I have either GERD or H. Pylori or whatever it is. No matter what I do all the methods I try it seems futile. These issues are one of the reasons that causes me bad breath. I've been to ENTs and one said to be stress is another reason that causes it but it's a cycle because the reason I'm stressed is because of people and because I have been teased for numerous things my whole life. I've been angered, I've been shamed, made fun of and everything else. People don't realize that under the surface I have been spending so much time and money fixing my issue to no avail. I'm exhausted now. This is affecting my everyday life. I do want to be healed one day but then I think what is the point. 
Now I have to look into getting either an endoscopy or a colonoscopy, and even that may not fix my issue but then again it doesn't hurt to try. If those two don't fix my issues than I'm at a severe loss of understanding what will. 

It will be even more money down the drain especially since I don't have insurance for that kind of stuff. Not only that but I already have past debt too I constantly have to worry about. Some is paid off but lots of it still needs to be handled. I really just don't like living life. I feel haunted by constant bad luck.
