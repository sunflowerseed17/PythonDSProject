I have mental and physical illnesses (so not just depression) that have made me unable to work. For almost 7 years now my kid and I have lived with assistance (both govt, parents and friend). 
I have been in therapy and on meds, but nothing has changed enough to make a difference on the job front. 
I hate being a burden to the people around me, hate being in the position to need their help and to be judged for it. And the help won’t last too much longer - parents are old, friend won’t be around much longer, etc. But if I can’t change my job situation - which directly impacts my ability to maintain survival - what else is there?
