Hi hi!
I (23F, 5’7) lost 30 pounds (260–> 230) these last 4 months due to a lot of different lifestyle changes. I’ve cut out fast food and most junk foods (i cant give up Takis). I stopped drinking soda and I’ve been more intentional with walking and jogging twice a week. Ive also finally gotten a good routine, medication management, and therapist to help manage my mental health struggles that contributed to my binging problems.

MY WAIST IS BACK!!!! I ballooned during COVID due to quarantine and the subsequent mental health crisis I had lead to me jumping from 170 to 280. Safe to say…. I haven’t had my “womanly shape” since before 2020, I’ve been straight as a board, no waist. But today I put on a tank top and looked in the mirror and for the first time in years… there’s a very noticeable dip at my waist. I’m so so so happy. I have problems with seeing myself as feminine due to be being bullied in primary school for being too boyish looking. So to look myself in the mirror and see my grown women self, I felt such a wave of confidence. I feel hot, I feel sexy, I feel like myself, and I feel so confident.
