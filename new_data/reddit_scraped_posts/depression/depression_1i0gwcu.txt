I recently just lost connections with an online friend she was really nice to me and i loved talking to her everyday and she was the reason why i got up in the morning. she told me she was flirting with other guys from reddit and stuff and i got really jealous and had a mental breakdown she deleted most of her accounts she still has me added on discord but i think she deleted it from her phone. i haven’t eaten since and i just feel awful all the time. she was my only friend and i had lost that. now i feel helpless without her she would always comfort me when i was sad now that’s gone. i struggle a lot with social anxiety making it really hard for me to meet new people i really don’t know what to do with myself anymore.
