It's weird because having ANC off does a much better job at blocking things out. Fans and stuff in the background are completely gone with ANC off but when I turn it on, I can noticeability hear it. Everything is louder with ANC on compared to having it off. Yes, I do have a good fit, they're snug and deep in my ears. I'm using the WF-1000XM5
