I always feel like a burden, a worthless pile of shit. I cry a lot. I don’t feel good about myself. No one is ever attracted to me. When I tried to confess to someone, he turned me down. I was always told I’m fat. My siblings were always complimented for being beautiful and thin while I’m always the fat and although they don’t say it, I know they find me ugly. 
People will say I should just change my outlook in life. But how could I if I started believing all those things. I try to workout but I do not have the motivation. I keep thinking what’s the point in all of this? I have my faith which keeps me company. I have friends, don’t get me wrong, but they do not know about these things. I am not suicidal but I often wonder, if I were to be gone, would anyone really miss me and look for me aside from my immediate family?
