I don't know if I'm gonna make it to 18. I gave up on being clean. I gave up on getting anything done I gave up on keeping food down. What do I do is consume liquid calories and rot in my bed.Vomiting up I mea What I do is consume liquid calories and rot in my bed I take my medication every now and again. Doesn't fucking help anyway. 6 months sober solely because I can't get my hands-on alcohol. I'm a disgrace. My mom was right I am a fucking mistake. I can't do anything right. I can't fucking get out of bed for more than fifteen god damn minutes. I can't work on my projects in the workshop.I can't do anything. I can't even focus on a goddamn youtube Video anymore. Can barely enjoy music. Hell I  don't enjoy much of it anymore. Please kill me, please
