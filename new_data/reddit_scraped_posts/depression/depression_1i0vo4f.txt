I have had depression for over 7 years and these past few months have been pretty hard. I have never had many intrusive thoughts before, but these past few months, I have been having lots of intrusive suicidal thoughts. It is at the point where I have these thoughts everyday. I discussed this with my therapist. I told her that I donâ€™t think it is a very big deal because I know I am not a threat to myself. But I have noticed my memory has been getting worse and worse. It feels like all memories is through frosted glass. My therapist mentioned that this could be due to excessive intrusive thoughts and I was wondering if anyone else has had the same/similar experience?
