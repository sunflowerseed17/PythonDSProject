Not sure if this is Agoraphobia, but basically I’ve been struggling to go outside for almost half of this year.

I have been diagnosed with MDD and PTSD, and I’m currently getting medicated for them.

Basically I hate the process of getting ready and going out in general, as it makes me feel suffocated somewhat.

I feel like I wouldn’t be able to get ready on time or I might get stuck during the process.

I’ve assumed that my fear of going out was linked directly to depression and maybe ptsd, since depression can also make you lose interest in going outside.

But idk why, I’d feel so much dread just from the thought of it. I wasn’t like that at all in the beginning of 2024. 

Could that be caused by Agoraphobia? I’ll discuss this with my doctor of course, but I wanted to see if anyone else find this relatable and if it does have things to do with agoraphobia.
