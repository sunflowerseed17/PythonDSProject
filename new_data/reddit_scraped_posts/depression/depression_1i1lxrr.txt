i had an attempt back in september or october last year, before it i was on fluoxetine for a few months and then afterwards i was put on escitalopram and have been going to therapy. but idk i still feel the exact same as i did back then and i just wanna know when i'll actually start to feel "better" like how long does it take for the medication to actually work?? thank u if you read this and respond
