I was diagnosed with depressive symptoms 7 months ago, There are days when I don't think too much, but today I feel like I'm so weird, this week I've felt awful, I feel like I'm a weird person, and I really am, my humor is very weird and I don't like being like that, I struggle so much to speak, I feel so insecure and I feel like nothing is getting better, I have never had a partner or been in a relationship and I think this is all because of my personality and weird humor, besides I'm not that attractive, I hate my profile, I have a low chin and it feels really bad, I feel like I look weird, I would like to know how to feel better or how to change :( I find so many flaws, above all in my personality, mainly because of some childhood traumas that make socializing difficult for me. 
It's so hard to get out of bed sometimes, I feel like I'll never accomplish anything in my life.
Sometimes I've wanted to die, sometimes I think that's the way out, sometimes when I think about it I feel better but I don't want to hurt my family, Any advice on how to stop thinking so much? Thanks for reading all my venting.
