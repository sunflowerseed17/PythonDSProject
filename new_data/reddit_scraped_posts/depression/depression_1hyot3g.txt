The topic of mental disorders seems to  interest those without a lot, and I get it, it’s an interesting topic.
But they seem not to notice when they cross the line. You see, when you don’t know about a mental illness much, you don’t have the right to talk about it like you’re a person who has is. Don’t spread your false beliefs and add stigma around them.
I’m a person diagnosed with 3 common illnesses, but I don’t openly talk about it to people. And some people don’t realise that mental illnesses aren’t always visible, and start talking about them in front me. 
And it’s just so maddening how often it happens.
I also hear people talking about it in public, and often they’re being just straight ableistic. 
It makes me feel very offended and makes me want to offend them as well.
