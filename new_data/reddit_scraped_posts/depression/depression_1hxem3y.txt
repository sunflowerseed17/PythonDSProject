I’m literally typing this as Tell Me It’s You is playing. And I JUST realised. Taka heard everything. He HEARD Mufasa defend him and argue his case in front of Sarabi. And he STILL betrayed him. I CANNOT feel sorry for Taka oh my god. (Although I still feel the love triangle was unnecessary).

Okay now bye,
Places to go, kingdoms to see!
