I apologize if I'm all over the place. I've dealt with depression since i was in my teens (28 now). I had a Rocky childhood (father left me at age 5, mother left me at age 15, stayed with aunt who would mentally and verbally abuse me). My mom is bipolar, sister has been clinically diagnosed as bipolar, and I'm sure I am as well.

I get the typical depression episodes where I sleep in, don't want to do anything at all. I also get the uncontrollable sadness episodes where I constantly remind myself how much of a piece of crap I am, wanting so much to die, etc.

There's this other thing that happens that I don't understand where I see a friend happy and it just instantly puts me into a deep pit of sadness, not at that very moment, but when I exit and be by myself. I get a strong feeling of wanting them to be happy. Wanting to do something for them. Wanting to literally ask them if they are happy (I've done it already). The whole time I'm just a wreck, like bawling my eyes out wreck and cannot get out of it. Almost like a panic attack.

Make no mistake, it's not a "you're happy and I am not so I'm sad" thing. It's more a "I really want you to be happy and I'm devastated because I think you're not". How weird is that? These episodes are rare and completely unexpected. It would be nice if I find someone that has similar moments.

P.S. My daughter single handedly cured my depression after she was born 2 years ago. I have not had any episodes of any kind for over a year, until 2 weeks ago I had one of these moments catch me completely by surprise after seeing a friend say hello to me with a big smile on his face.
