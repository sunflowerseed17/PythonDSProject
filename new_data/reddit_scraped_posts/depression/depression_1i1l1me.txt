I’m 14 and my mom has ruined every single one of my 8 friendships in the past year, i feel like i can’t tell her i’m depressed and it’s all her fault, she keeps threatening to take off my door and all of my stuff, i don’t know what to do right now. I always have a messy room and a lot of trash everywhere, my dad is also very loud towards me and i feel like i can’t confess to anything to my parents, i don’t like to talk to them because they make me feel unsafe in a way.
