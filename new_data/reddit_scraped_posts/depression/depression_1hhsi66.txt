Not the typical Dallas type. Also don’t really care about status or money, as I’m not obsessed with it at all. Or anything materialistic really. Hinge has been… meh. Okay. Probably done better than a lot of guys, and worse than a lot of others. 

I’m intrigued by the henderson/Greenville weekend night crowd but from my copious interactions with them it seems like a terrible fit no matter how hot they are. I guess im just looking for an intellectual that i also happen to be sexually attracted to. Someone kinda nerdy, kinda different. Someone who's not your typical corporate/religious/conservative/tik tok dallas type. But other than the once a blue moon hinge match seems impossible to find. Am I just boned in this city if thats what im looking for?
