My parents, they did so much for my brother in terms of supporting him and getting him help for his depression amongst other things completely neglected to do anything for me by the time I needed it they gave him an awesome grad party and thousands of dollars he pissed away on useless shit 

Meanwhile I was 14 and not there yet but when I graduated my dad was fully engrossed in shooting up heroin and my mom a single mother trying to live her life like she was 16 again simply didnâ€™t care to make sure I had that same kind of energy added to my achievements to them I guess I wasnâ€™t worth much or even if they couldnâ€™t afford it I just donâ€™t think it was fair to make me the outcast I canâ€™t even go to grad-parties without leaving 10 minutes into it from ptsd and from not even having a chance to have one for myself ever I still have yet to have a party at that kind of level but it will never happen let alone going to college ðŸ¥² I feel so left out of life like everyone has cool things they can look back on but all I can remember is how I tried not to kill myself feeling worthless to everyone 

I still feel this wayâ€¦ I doesnâ€™t go away I had to get new insurance this year and I canâ€™t find a doctor in time for me to refill my meds for all of this fucked up shit canâ€™t see my psychiatrist anymore and even better the therapist I was with all year I had to stop seeing him I hope I make it through this I just donâ€™t think I have it in me anymore
