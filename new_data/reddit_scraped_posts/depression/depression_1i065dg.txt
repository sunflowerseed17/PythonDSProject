I am a 26 year old male, and I am 4 feet 8 inches tall, which is about the height of the average 10 year old. I have a form of dwarfism called Nutritional Dwarfism, a condition in which a person is unusually short in stature as a result of having been chronically undernourished during childhood or adolescence. In my case, I starved myself throughout my adolescence since I was dealing with a lot of mental and emotional problems, and as a result of that, my body was never able to grow beyond 4'8''.

Since my dwarfism is proportionate rather than disproportionate, people often mistake me for a little child (even though I have facial hair), so much so that it is pretty much impossible for me to live a normal life. Everywhere I go, whether it be a gym, a bar, a mall, or even a damn grocery store, people always stop me and prevent me from going about my business like a normal person because they think that I'm a little ass kid. And of course when I try to explain my situation to them, most of the time they don't believe me. Hell, there's even been times where I've actually shown my ID and pointed out my facial hair to people, and they still don't believe me when I tell them that I'm 26!

I really wish that I hadn't starved myself during my adolescence, then I would've grown up to be the normal adult male height that I was supposed to be, and I would be able to live a normal life without constantly being harassed and discriminated against by others because of the prejudices that they have about my dwarfism. All I want to do is live my life. Is that so much to ask?!?!
