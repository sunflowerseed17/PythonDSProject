sorry this episode ALWAYS wrecks me. i’m not even the biggest Dodds stan but this episode….. i’ve seen it 5 times and STILL get my hopes up that he’ll walk out of that house 😔😔 i’m glad he got to say goodbye to his dad and fiancé though. 

they didn’t search him 😩😩
the gun didn’t even go off on purpose 😩😩
rapha is being threatened 😩😩 
it was dodds LAST EFFING DAYYYYY 😩😩
his brother was on the way 😩😩
dodds saying “we can see him breathing. his heart is beating… it’s STRONG” GODDDDD
