29F. I just feel so damn afraid of everything all the time. My current job has become shitty and I need to find a new job, but that is giving me massive anxiety. First, finding a new job is tough for me and it’s difficult for me to crack interviews because I am dumb and nervous. Second, I am just so afraid to join a new job. I am unable to imagine myself in a new job because I feel so afraid. My immediate thought is “I won’t be able to do it”. This has obviously resulted in a vicious cycle in which I am afraid to even apply as my mind believes that I won’t be able to do it. 
Apart from the job thing, everything else is also not so good. I am just angry and confused all the time. I can’t do normal tasks or feel normal for more than 4-5 days a month. I also have brain fog. I have tried to cut down phone use etc but I just keep fucking things up. It feels like I am self-sabotaging. I try to improve and exercise, eat healthy etc but then quit. I even tried the slow change and habit stacking approaches but I have no patience. I have taken therapy and it has helped me in many ways but I don’t think it can help anymore beyond a point. I am just stuck. I don’t feel good about myself at all. I have developed pimples on my face, my weight keeps increasing and I don’t even like to look in the mirror. I feel like crying all the time, especially during PMS. I don’t know what to do. I am just spiralling again
