Just got my 15 limited about a month ago and is a very nice comfy car.Picked up a friend and he immediately called me a white mom.I found it funny as I've said the same ðŸ˜‚.I'm just curious about what anyone has done to their GC cosmetic wise?
I've been thinking of vinyl pinstripes,and maybe, maybe a front skirt but that's a maybe.
