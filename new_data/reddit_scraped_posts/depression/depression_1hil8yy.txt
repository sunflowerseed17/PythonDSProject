This breakup has broken me. The guilt I feel is unbearable. I feel I ruined the best thing that has ever happened to me. I can’t live with my self. Night terrors, disrupted sleep, can’t brush my teeth or do basic hygiene routines, and I’m a shell of myself. I can’t stop thinking of her sleeping with other guys, which I know she is as she told me. My confidence is shattered and I can’t forgive myself. I’m in a crisis outpatient program and it’s like using a ladle to bail out the titanic. Multiple sessions a week, peer counseling, medication, I’m constantly calling crisis lines just to get through the day. I’ve had multiple severe mental breakdowns. This has been going on for months. I will take my life soon and I know it. I deserve it. Can’t live without her. I was suicidal before I met her and now I’m worse than ever.
