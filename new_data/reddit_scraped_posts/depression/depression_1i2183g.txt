So, I have been having suicidal ideation. I feel that there isn't a particular way out in my situation, so to speak. I am drained, emotionally disregulated, and overall just empty. I have not made plans to act on suicide, and I don't think I will. However, I have noticed that I'm willing to act on risky behavior. One thing that I do, I'm not sure if it is self harm or not, is turn on the water extremely hot when I'm in the shower. Hotter than I usually have it. It doesn't burn me, but it definitely turns my skin red. I'm worried that this will escalate. But sometimes it's nice to just feel it.
