I’m listening to sound reviews for the WF-1000XM5 on YouTube compared to other earbuds and I’m listening to the WF-1000XM5 and it sounds especially bad. It sounds like it has wayyy too much low and mids and maybe too much bass? It sounds very muddy because of that. I mean, surely that’s not actually the case? I’m listening to these reviews from an audio engineer but wouldn’t he know this is stupid because it’s gonna sound MUCH different because I’m using headphones that aren’t what’s being reviewed? Or I am missing something?
