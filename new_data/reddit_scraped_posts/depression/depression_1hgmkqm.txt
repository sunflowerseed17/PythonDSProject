I think everyone here has a reason to be lonely. I don’t post much here and I think the reason why is because I’m afraid of rejection. However, I’d give anything to just have someone talk to me. 
I’d literally give an arm if it meant I can have a meaningful connection with someone. Fuck sex, fuck intimacy. I just want to talk. ANYTHING. I will literally let you talk just hear someone’s voice. That’s how pathetic it is. 


This is literally a discussion but also an open invitation. I don’t care what you talk about. I just want something to come out of it. Some kind of connection because I literally can’t take the isolation anymore.
