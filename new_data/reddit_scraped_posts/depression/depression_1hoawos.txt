Please be honest. After my psychiatrist suggested me developing a bipolar disorder, i wonder how well i relate to the bipolar community. The question is not if you believe or think you suffer more than everybody, it is if you feel so. I am sorry if i sound a bit cringe but i really can't find any better way to express myself right now. I think i am in a depressive episode, and sometimes it feels like everyone else is able to continue their oh so stable lives while the smallest inconvenience completely overthrows me. My family doesn't care about how i actually feel, they only care about how well i function as a daughter. Heck, they don't even want me to get a bipolar diagnosis, since they believe this would make me getting a job way harder. But no one knows how much i actually suffer. When i am able to talk about my pain a bit, other people say they suffer as well but it seems like no one actually tries to solve a problem, they only whine and complain. I don't want to undermine anyone's problem and sorrow, and i know it's a so real thing but i know not everyone suffers and experiences pain the same way or the same amount. I think this is just a fact. I know my biggest war is against myself.

If you are able to relate to what i wrote, how do you deal with such thoughts and feelings? I try to take things easier on myself when i realise i am slipping into bad thoughts and direct my energy to something productive or creative. I actively decide on a solution if i know the problem, and build small, achievable steps to solve the problem so i can at least feel better.
