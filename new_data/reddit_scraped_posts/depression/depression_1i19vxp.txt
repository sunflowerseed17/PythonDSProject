19M I just found out that I was manipulating my boyfriend 19M I’ve been trying to be a better partner/person so I’ve been changing for the better, we both agreed this probably have something to do with my autism I don’t feel the same as others I don’t really know how I can explain it once I found out about it I couldn’t even think I just broke down into tears I felt so many emotions I didn’t know what to do, I’m tied of myself why did I have to be born and raised by people with so many problems I just keep asking myself how didn’t I know that I was doing this to the person I love and hold so dearly I’ve done so many horrible things and he stayed with me, we’re both fighting hard for our friendship I’m willing to change and take accountability for my actions, I’m just so tired I’m confused and worried about my future with him I’m scared of losing someone that showed me love and commitment I’ve never felt that from my own family I just think about giving up on don’t know how many times he’s pulled me back to safety over and over again, I just wanted to be born by a family that actually cared about me now that I have one I don’t know, am I worth it I hate myself for giving him such a hard time maybe I just give up.
