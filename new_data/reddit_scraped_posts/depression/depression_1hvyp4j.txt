Even if you love your life, what are you gonna do when your entire family dies? Not to mention the fact that everyone you meet and befriend, you are going to outlive them all. 

And if you get past all of that, won’t you eventually get really bored? Hundreds of years will pass. And you could eventually feel like you can’t have any good connections because they’ll just eventually leave you anyways. 

And after hundreds of years of living, wouldn’t you feel like you’ve done everything there is to be done within your capability? 

And if you manage to overcome that, unless humanity lives long enough and finds a way off this planet and successfully settles onto another one. The sun will explode killing all life on earth. You would just be drifting through space alone assuming you’re immortal + Indestructible.
