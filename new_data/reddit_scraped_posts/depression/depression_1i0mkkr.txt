I’m really struggling and need to get this off my chest. Every day, I wear this mask of being the nice guy, the one who always seems happy and is eager to help. You know, the guy who would give you the shirt off his back. But deep down, I’m battling feelings of sadness and depression. 

Sometimes, I find myself wishing for a way out—a dramatic exit, like a T-bone collision on my way to work. Honestly, I’ve even tried to take that route since I was 8, but somehow, I’ve always been pulled back from the brink by some twist of fate. It's like I’m constantly chasing death, yet I treat life like it’s just another job, hoping all my good deeds will someday be recognized.
