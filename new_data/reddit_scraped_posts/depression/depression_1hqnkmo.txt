After going through years of what I would call emotional abuse, I finally confronted him with the fact that I haven't been happy for a while because kf his behavior.  He keeps telling me that he's sorry and that he didn't realize how deeply he had hurt me. He didn't know that it was bothering me that badly because I wouldn't tell him how I felt. He's now changing his behavior and even then it doesnt feel real. It feels like there's some invisible threat around now. Like it's a trick. Has anyone else experienced this?
