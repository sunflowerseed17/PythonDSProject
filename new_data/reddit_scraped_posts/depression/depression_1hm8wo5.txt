I tried testing the battery and it seems like the right drains 6% every 10 minutes and the left drains 5% every 10 minutes with LDAC on, playing music at 60% volume, that's it, nothing else on. Is this good battery life? If we do the math, it'll only last about 2-3 hours. I literally just got them too, didn't update
