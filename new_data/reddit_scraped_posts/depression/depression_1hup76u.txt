I want to just.... completely change my last name. I still have my married name because it's the same last name as my kids. But they are grown now. And I don't want the same last name as my dad because there's a lot of trauma there. So, essentially, idk what to change it too. Maybe my best friends last name lol, but she's ganna get married and have that changed and well... that's ganna be weird but I love her maiden last name ðŸ˜‚
