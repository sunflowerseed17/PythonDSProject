I feel a constant pressure inside of my head—like something is on the verge of erupting. This pressure doesn't go away or taper off—it only gets worse as time goes by. I think that i have felt so depressed, so done with it all for so long that i have just lost any understanding of what it feels like to be happy or at peace, even if it be for only a moment. People like to say, "It will get better, small steps" etc but that is simply not the case, with me at least. People around me think that me somehow taking better care of myself, making positive changes like getting another job, socialising will somehow fix things. They think i feel this way because of this. I FELT THIS WAY LONG BEFORE I ISOLATED MYSELF FROM EVERYONE, LONG BEFORE I STOPPED EXERCISING, SOCIALISING, TAKING GOOD CARE OF MYSELF. I HAVE ALREADY TRIED THIS, I HAVE TRIED THIS FOR MANY MANY MANY YEARS. For whatever reason i might start feeling okay for a fleeting moment—then this horrible deep feeling of despair and pain washes over me and it goes back to square one. Someone could say to me tomorrow you will have all the money you could ever want, nice haircut, good body etc, i'd still feel as bad and horrible as i do now. I just need to face the fact that i was never meant to be alive, to be born—to be apart of this world.
