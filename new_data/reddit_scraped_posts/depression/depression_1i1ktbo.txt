We'll my fianc√© who I've been with for a year has joined the navy recently and is currently about half way threw with basic  since she has been gone I have felt empty and alone I have never been a sad person or someone who easily gets in there feelings but I just can't seem to shake the depressive thoughts it's effecting my job now I've become angry with coworkers and customers lashing out because I am so tired of putting on a smile and acting like I feel okay when I'm just not. I miss her a lot but I don't know if this is what I want anymore she will deploy twice in her 5 year contract an I can't even begin to fathom the idea of being without her for that long I am scared that if I don't leave her now that I will just cause her more pain and suffering a year down the road if I end up not being able to be alone for six months at a time idk feeling lost and need guidance? I appreciate everyone who takes the time to reply
