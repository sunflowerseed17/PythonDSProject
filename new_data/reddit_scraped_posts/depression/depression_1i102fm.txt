Hi I’m 19F & today has been a whirlwind and I feel awful. I haven’t ate anything today, I’ve been crying randomly and I’ve been trying to stop it but it keeps coming out. I bought something for about $40 & I hate it & I can’t return it so I feel extremely stupid. A show I was suppose to go to got canceled and I can’t get my plane tickets refunded which isn’t too bad because I get to see my friend that I haven’t seen in 3 years but I still feel upset. A guy that was close friends with my friends (we’ve hanged out once but that was it) passed away a few days ago & I feel horrible about it still even though we barely knew each other. I also feel horrible for my friends too because they’d always talk about him to me. I’m also in $600 of debt right now and my job is barley scheduling me because of low sales this month. I don’t want to do anything but also I want to be  productive but I feel stuck, like I can’t move. When I do try to get myself up I just cry. I wish I could have a hug or just talk to someone but I hate when I feel like this because I feel so gross and unproductive. I feel insanely stressed out for no reason and I’m trying to be better before I go back to college in a week but I feel like I can’t do anything. This might sound overdramatic after reading this but I’ve also been having a lot of family trauma flashbacks since coming home and it’s been giving me horrible nightmares for the past month. I just don’t know how else to comfort myself when I’ve tried exercising, watching movies, playing games, going outside for a bit, and I keep crying.
