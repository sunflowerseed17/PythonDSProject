She broke up with me. It’s my fault too, she was the only one to look my way and I pushed her away. I am an idiot. I have jealously issues, I’ve resented her bit by bit over the time we’ve been dating because of this, until she had enough and pulled the plug. I am a sad pathetic idiot. Now that she’s gone I miss her. I wish I had closure, we haven’t spoken since the break up, which was brief.
