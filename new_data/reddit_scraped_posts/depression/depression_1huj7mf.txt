Asking this because I’m about to head to the laundromat, and for the past few years as an adult doing my own laundry I’ve always washed my whites with whites, and colors with colors. 

Will I ruin my clothing if I wash them all together? Like washing my colored sweaters with my white tees and black tees etc. all materials are cotton or cotton blends

But with the loads being a little expensive, I wanted to know if it’s okay to wash my plain white tee shirts with my plain black tee shirts, and my colored Nike graphic tees all together in one load to save an extra $5 a load. same goes for my white Nike socks and my black Nike socks. 

I have washed the socks together before and my white socks ended up having black lint specks on them, which honestly I don’t really acre too much about? It’s just everyday clothing for me just to go to work or go out
