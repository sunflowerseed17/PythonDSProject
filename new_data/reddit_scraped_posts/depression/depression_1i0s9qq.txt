I (20F) there is no point to write here but I'll do it anyway, since 2022 or a little before that i think i got depressed and got diagnosed in 2023 and taking antidepressant ever since i tried every solution that comes to my mind i used to love my life and life no matter what happened even in the bad days now my life is better than before but I'm not I'm tierd i hate myself because i can't do anything about the things i hate because I'm depressed i don't feel like wanting anything ever like absolutely nothing to watch or do etc, I'm close to graduate from university and I'm scared because i was hardly just doing what i have to do but then. What? I want to want to do things but i can't I'm just so fucking tierd of trying.
