Hi everyone, I'm just gonna be taking a break from this sub due to some recent islamophobic comments that were made. This might seem a little silly but i have depression and sometimes things can be a little much!
I love you all and I hope to see you back soon. Take care everyone ❤️

Btw, if you're a fellow Muslim in this sub or just want to make me feel better, I'd love some comforting messages :3
