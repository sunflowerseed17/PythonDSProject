I'm looking at getting some posters of bands I like.My problem is these bands ain't very mainstream anymore so no one's gonna a have posters unless it $40+ on ebay.I don't care about authenticity just some to add in my bedroom.I was at Walmart and they have these computers that can print out pictures and I seen posters were an option.They came in many different sizes but I've never seen anyone use them before.Id just get the image off the internet and use my phone.Haa anyone done this,is the process easy,is the quality good?
