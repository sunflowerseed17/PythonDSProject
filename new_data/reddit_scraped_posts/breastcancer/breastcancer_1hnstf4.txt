Just my oncotype score- 40. I have had 2 different recommendations for chemo 4 rounds of TC or 20 weeks ACT. These were recommended before I got the score. Stage 2, grade 3, +  - -, spread to at least 1 lymph node.

My question is did anyoneâ€™s oncotype score change the kind of chemo that was recommended?
