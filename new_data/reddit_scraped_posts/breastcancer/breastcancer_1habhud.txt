Hey all, I am genuinely curious 


We do not sleep train, no shade on those that do. We had intentions of trying but life has been a bit different since my little guy turned about 6m old.

At this current time I am mostly home and only working a few hours a week. He turns 1 in a few weeks and because of medical reasons I will be still home a few more months after he is 1. 

I do not wake him up,  in the am until he wakes up himself and only from naps if we have an appointment(it's happened 1 time)

What about everyone else? I think if I had to leave for work a certain time and needed to do daycare it would be different. Right now nanny comes to use the days I do work or have appointments.
