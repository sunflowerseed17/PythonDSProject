Surgery consult is coming up in 2 weeks and just wanted to get other people’s perspectives or what they did.

My diagnosis is grade 3 TNBC and I am 32. I did most of my chemo but opted out of completely my last round of the red devil with support of my doctor due to a hyperthyroid, possible GERD, a platelet transfusion and issue keeping my blood cells up. My doctor said she can’t say for certain but due to having more then one tumor in my breast I have a higher chance of the surgeon wanting to take the whole breast so I’ve been mentally preparing for that. 

My question is, did anyone who needed to have a mastectomy ask their surgeon to just take both? And if so did insurance cover it? Just trying to hear experiences before going in and having this talk.
