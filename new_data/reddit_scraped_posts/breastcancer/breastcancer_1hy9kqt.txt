I have my surgery consult next week. And if they tell me they are taking my breast I want to do a mold casting of my boobs first for fun. But the kits I’m finding online have crappy reviews. Anyone done something like this?

I saw the belly castings for pregnancy have good reviews so I was thinking maybe that’d work for since this is just for fun and I’m weird.
