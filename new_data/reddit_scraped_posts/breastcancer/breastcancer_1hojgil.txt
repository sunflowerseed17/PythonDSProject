Just installed Monarch yesterday and enjoying it already, it’s very similar to an app I used in the UK before moving to the US. 

I also like that you can add others in your household - I’m recently married and my husband and I will be figuring out how we want to manage shared finances and expenses. 

However I don’t necessarily want him to see all of my accounts and transactions. Not because I’m hiding anything but he just doesn’t need all that info - and similarly I don’t need to see all his personal spending. 

Does anyone else use Monarch for shared expenses as well as their own personal spending, and what’s your setup? 

If you filter which accounts to show/hide, is that personal to your account (if I hide his accounts on my device, that won’t hide them on his)?
