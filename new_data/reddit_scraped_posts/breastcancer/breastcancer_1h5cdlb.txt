I have one more chemo treatment left before surgery: and honestly I just want to skip it. I’ve been so sick the last three weeks I can’t walk long distances. I now have issues with my thyroid now and possible GERD. I just had to have a platelet transfusion. I’m just done honestly: I don’t see the point in doing the last round if they are just taking my entire breast anyway. 


Has anyone just said no to the last round and went straight to surgery?
