I'm heading into my second TCHP treatment tomorrow and that along with my Dr. appt yesterday has me spiraling (lymph node positive!).  Last night my husband wanted to take me to ER because I was crying, shaking and screaming uncontrollably.  I got through the first chemo round, but the thought of another one is scaring me all over again.  I feel like the cancer and/or the treatment is trying to kill me.  The cancer cloud won't go away. My brain is definitely not helping me; I think it is broken.   I have Ativan for emergencies (took one last night).  I was unable to take Lexapro as it made me ill.    How do folks cope with the crippling anxiety?   I can't do this for 4 more months.
