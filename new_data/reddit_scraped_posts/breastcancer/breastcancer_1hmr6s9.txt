diagnosed Christmas Eve with the following: I have a call with Dr Lee at southwest surgical already per a referral from a friend of the family. I know MD Anderson is what everyone would say but would love opinions on surgeons and radiologist/oncologists at memorial Hermann memorial city? It’s closer to me and I’m thinking not being as large as MDA might be a bit more personal and less wait times? New to all of this. I’m terrified. I have two young children and I just want the best care possible! Thank you so much!
