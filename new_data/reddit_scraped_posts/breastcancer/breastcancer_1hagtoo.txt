Background: It took several months from my first diagnosis to my first treatment (surgery).  Although originally I was just told I would need surgery and radiation, now they are adding chemo to my treatment plan.

So now I am trying to decide who I will trust with my care going forward. I met with a wonderful oncologist at a hospital about an hour away. She did a great job explaining my options and answering my questions. BUT, I just found out that that hospital may be out of network starting in January.

I am also meeting a local oncologist later today. I am worried that I will have the same delay in care that I had with the surgeon (same hospital). I also get nervous around doctors, so having someone I can communicate clearly with is important to me. Obviously I don't know their communication style yet.

So my main questions is, how often will I actually meet with the oncologist during my treatment? Would your prioritize a doctor you trust or someone closer to home and definitely in my insurance network.
