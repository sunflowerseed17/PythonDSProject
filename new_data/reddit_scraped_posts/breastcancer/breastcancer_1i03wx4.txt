I feel like this isn't possible. But, I was also adjusting myself while getting ready this morning and realized I couldn't feel my mass as easily. Prior to chemo I could gently graze my skin and feel it poking through. But now I have to sort of press in to feel it. What could've happened that it feels different? Just a tissue shift of some sort? My mass is free moving...Idk if that makes a difference. It has me worried.

ETA: Thank you all! You've turned my worry into relief ðŸ¤—
