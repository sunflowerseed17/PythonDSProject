The scene when Lenu hugs teen Dede and notes how she grew, and how for so long she had been so disgusted by her mother really resonated with me. Captured completely the feeling of raising a young teenage girl into a young woman in a single scene.

Also excuse my title, which I cannot edit and I voice posted. Meant to say the scene that killed me with sorrow.
