Hi everyone, I am anxiously awaiting the results of the double biopsy I had last week. Fingers crossed the cancer hasnâ€™t returned.  While I wait I have been thinking a lot about food choices / diet.

I already brought this up with my breast care nurses / oncologist when I got my original diagnosis last year. They reassured me that food doesnâ€™t really cause cancer, but there is still a part of brain that wonâ€™t stop worrying.

I generally eat a healthy diet with lots of veggies and some fruit- this is thanks to my wonderful 2nd husband who helps me eat regularly and healthily. Before I married him I went through a terrible 2 years ( divorce, huge stress and anxiety over losing my home ( I didnâ€™t ) and working a terrible schedule which also involved 4 hours a day on public transport. I ate badly ( lots of Greggs chicken bakes and I also drank a lot of red wine and was fairly sedentary thanks to poor diet, exhaustion and stress.

I feel those 2 years did a lot of damage. It hasnâ€™t helped that Iâ€™m also on citilopram which has decreased my ability to feel full. 

Now whenever I have bacon, gammon or salami I think am I introducing more carcinogens into my body? Iâ€™ve been told by friends that sugar is a poison so now I worry if I have a piece of cake. I also love dairy products - I have always drunk a lot of milk, I adore cheese, kefir and yoghurt.  

Although I am eating better,  I now feel anxious about having little treats here and there. Has anyone else experienced this? Have you radically changed your diet? Are things like tofu ( estrogen worries?) okay to eat. I keep worrying that Iâ€™m feeding the cancer. 

Thank you for reading. ðŸ’•
