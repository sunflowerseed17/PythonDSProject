Ok so today was super emotional, I had my first pelvic PT treatment session. I thought I was tough after getting through surgery, chemo, and radiation but hello emotions! I'm glad I am going but it's got to be one of the toughest parts of my after active BC treatment thing I'm doing. Ladies if you haven't talked to your Dr about pelvic health and are experiencing issues please do so! I can now see a light at the end of this stupid intimacy tunnel! Also, singing loudly in the car after to 4 Non Blonds "What's going on?" after an emotional appointment is very beneficial ðŸ˜‰
