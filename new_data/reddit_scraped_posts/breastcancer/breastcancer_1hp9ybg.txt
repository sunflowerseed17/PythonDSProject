Hi y'all, I'm nearly 2 months out from a double mastectomy with spacers. Getting the drains out was a huge relief. I lucked out with low onctype result which means no chemo/radiation. I am currently waiting for reconstruction surgery which is 5 months away (seems like forever). Is this an absurd amount of time to wait for recon surgery? I may be able to have it earlier if I switch surgeons. Also does anyone have timeframe estimates on when they began to feel better after recon?
