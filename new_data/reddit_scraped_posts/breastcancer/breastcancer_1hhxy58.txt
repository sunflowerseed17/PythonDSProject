Let see if we can name these extended family members without looking at google. 
The late Queens first cousins and families. 
The Duke of Kent 
The Duke of Glouster 
Princess Alexandra 
Prince Michael 

Kents have three children and nine grandchildren 
Glousters have three children and seven grandchildren 
The Ogolviys (Princess Alexandra) have two children. (P.A is widowed) and four grandchildren 
The Michaelâ€™s have two children and four grandchildren 

Thatâ€™s 40 assuming Duchess of Kent does not join. 

King Charlesâ€™ first cousins and families 
Lord Snowden is divorced and has two children 
Lady Chatto and husband have two children 

Thatâ€™s seven 

King Charles nieces and nephews and siblings 
Peter Philips and his two girls 
Zara Tindall, her husband and three children
Beatrice , her husband, her child and her stepson 
Eugenie, her husband and two children 
Princess Ann and husband 
Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh and their two children 

Thatâ€™s 22. 

Total 69. 

I saw in the news that Penelope Mountbatten joined the group. Thatâ€™s 70. 

Am I right? Who did  I miss? You can use google to fact check me ðŸ˜€
