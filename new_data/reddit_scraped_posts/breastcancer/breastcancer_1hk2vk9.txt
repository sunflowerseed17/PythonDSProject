Hi all- I was curious to hear if those with high ki-67 scores also usually had a high Oncotype score. Or I guess just generally what those numbers looked like for people who had both a ki-67% & oncotype score. 

I have IDC, ++-, grade 2 (mitosis 1), tumor is 2.4 cm per MRI,  no lymph node involvement per MRI & 2 ultrasounds (clinical stage 1). My ki-67 is 50% and I'm 37 (will be 38 Jan 3). My SO predicts I will need chemo, but that prediction seems mostly based on the ki-67%. I know that the ki-67% is just one indicator in formulating the oncotype, so I thought I'd ask people their scores to see what the trends seem to look like! I'll go straight into surgery (waiting on genetic testing to determine what type), but I'm just so anxious to know if I will need chemo!! I feel so weird  not knowing what the next several months of my life will look like. I realize there's no way to know for sure until I get the results on the oncotype back...  Waiting is hard ðŸ˜–

This question has been posed on this sub before but thought it may be worth it to bring up again? Thank you so much! I've been having a hard time lately (that's another post) and this sub is so helpful.
