After my radiation oncologist suggested Mepitel film (I‚Äôm in Canada), I did a lot of research before I decided to use it. But unlike most other topics (shout out to all you amazing people in this subreddit!), there wasn‚Äôt much information about Mepitel film use posted here. So, I promised myself I‚Äôd come back here and share my experience (even if my preferred mode is lurker ü§£).

I‚Äôve broken it down below and added links to help. Happy to answer any questions!

*NB: I was lucky that this was suggested to me, but this is not a standard of care everywhere. If you decide you want to use the film, you will need to work with your radiation oncology team for approval prior to radiation. The Facebook Group* [*Mepitel Film for Radiation Prophylaxis* ](https://facebook.com/groups/3165053997052275/)*had suggestions on how to ask and what research to show.*¬†

**‚ÑπÔ∏è My background for context**¬†

\++- IDC grade 2, stage 3. Finished AC-T dose-dense chemo in August ‚Äò24, partial mastectomy and ALND with matching lift/reduction in September 2024, 15 rounds of radiation with daily boosts completed in November 2024.¬†

**‚ùìWhat is** [**Mepitel Film**](https://www.molnlycke.ca/SysSiteAssets/master-and-local-markets/documents/canada/wound-care-documents/mepitelfilm_cewc01491905.pdf)**?**

A transparent and breathable wound care film. It works to keep small bacteria and viruses out, while also protecting the skin under it. (Don‚Äôt confuse it with Mepitel One which is a true bandage and will be sticky. Mepitel Film is not sticky - think of it like cling wrap.)

**‚ò¢Ô∏è How is it used for breast cancer radiation?**

The film comes in different-sized sheets. It is placed over the entire area that is being radiated (about 1 cm past your tattoos) and a patch on your back for the exit. You leave it on for the entire course of your radiation, then remove it and replace it after your last session, and leave it on again for at least 2 weeks after radiation. This protects your skin from irritants (like your clothes and other grime) and keeps your skin‚Äôs own biome together under it.¬†

Again, in Facebook Group [Mepitel Film for Radiation Prophylaxis](https://facebook.com/groups/3165053997052275/), you will hear other stories about how people use it, but this is the way it was used in the study and has so far shown to be clinically the most effective. But as always YMMV!

**ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Why bother with it?**

Several trials have shown that when Mepitel Film is applied and left on prior to radiation for breast cancer, it can reduce skin side effects by up to 80%.¬†I believe the Mayo Clinic had the largest trial to date.

Some research links:¬†

* [Research News](https://www.breastcancer.org/research-news/film-bandage-helps-protect-skin-during-radiation-therapy) from Breastcancer.org
* [Mepitel Film for the Prevention of Acute Radiation Dermatitis in Breast Cancer](https://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/JCO.22.01873) from Journal of Clinical Oncology

For me, I used Mepitel film throughout my radiation (whole breast, including collarbone and armpit) and ended up with only a small patch (less than the size of a quarter) of moist desquamation in my armpit and a slightly larger patch of dry desquamation down my side. I used a little Polysporin and saline soaks (as the nurse line suggested), and it healed well. Once the film came off, I used a little moisturizer, but honestly, my skin was fine - no other prescriptions or other moisturizing at any point.¬†This was pretty amazing considering the dose and location of my radiation. 

**‚ÄºÔ∏è Sounds great! So why isn‚Äôt it used everywhere?**

Well, this is a guess on my part, and I‚Äôm sure others can chime in, but it isn‚Äôt cheap. I had to pay for it myself ($70 Canadian for a box of 10 sheets, and I used 3 boxes).¬†

Also, it isn‚Äôt easy - at first! I had a wound care nurse help me do the initial placement, then I could patch mostly myself. (I know in some other countries, they will do it at radiation, but that wasn‚Äôt offered where I am.) It is hard to be essentially covered in plastic wrap over half your chest and armpit for 5-6 weeks. Yes, you can shower (covering it with a towel), but it‚Äôs challenging! Same with exercise - you need to be careful you aren't sweating too much, or be prepared to pay more to patch!

**üé© My Personal Tips and Tricks**

* Join the Facebook Group [Mepitel Film for Radiation Prophylaxis‚Äî](https://facebook.com/groups/3165053997052275/) excellent people with great tips and tricks.¬†
* Get the 10x25 size and buy a box. Find somewhere that gives you a volume discount if possible. I am plus size and still have large breasts post-partial mastectomy, and I used 3 boxes (almost 1 full one at the start, 1 for patching, and 1 for full replacement after 2 weeks), many others use fewer. I found this size the easiest to use for both initial placement and for cutting to trim.
* Get it professionally put on for the first application or have a good friend do it who can follow directions. The video helps to watch (and I did - many times! ü§£).
* You can patch yourself mostly if need be‚Äî so if you live alone, don‚Äôt be afraid.¬†(I hated the idea of being dependent on someone else for this, but after the initial placements, I could do it all myself - other than when I had to patch my back!)
* Rolls and creases and such don‚Äôt matter - you can cut them off and patch them. The radiation will get through. (Remind yourself when you panic like I do, that there is a giant, thick door for the radiation room because it will get through!)
* The overlapping of less than 1-2 cm is to stop it from rolling and save replacement. The radiation will get through and will do its job/won‚Äôt harm you more if you‚Äôve overlapped. (Again, remind yourself of the giant door and how everyone leaves the room! ). I know there is some disagreement about this in the community - some people absolutely say it should not overlap - I have no idea how they managed to avoid it! But great, if you think you can have it meet perfectly, go for it! The goal is to cover and protect your skin. 
* Leave it on for at least 2 weeks after - my RO even said 3. Let it roll off or peel it off in the shower. Pulling it off without the water does hurt your skin.¬†
* I wore a tight bamboo fibre long sleeve shirt over the film, then my bra over that, then a regular t-shirt throughout (I'm actually still doing that - not quite comfortable with a bra on my scars yet!). I think the undershirt really helped protect the film from my bra and other clothes rubbing it. I saw someone else posting here that in Japan they have you wear silk next to radiated skin - I think that would be great too!

**üíµ Where to Buy**

I am in Canada, so I was lucky and could buy locally. The Facebook Group [Mepitel Film for Radiation Prophylaxis](https://facebook.com/groups/3165053997052275/) has some good suggestions if you need it shipped.¬†
