I am having a DMX and think it might be hard to come home and see my old bras in my new body if I canâ€™t use them anymore. I am staying flat and plan to wear prosthetics. I am considering getting rid of them (donate and/or toss)  before my surgery but was wondering if you were able to use them for prosthetics or do you need bras specifically designed for prosthetics?
