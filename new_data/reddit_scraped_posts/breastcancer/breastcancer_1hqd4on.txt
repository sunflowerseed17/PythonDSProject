I’m undergoing neoadjuvant TCHP and expecting mastectomy around March, then more of some kind of chemo TBD depending on response, then I don’t know yet if I’m getting radiation.

I’m finding marking the new year difficult - usually I feel some optimism and refreshed by new years, but mostly all I feel is dread and a sense of being cheated. A whole year of doubling over, anal fissures, numb heels and prickling pain, tasteless food, numerous indignities, and being relatively useless at work, and every conversation with every family member and friend making its way to cancer and side effects, and amputated sensitive body parts and pain and drains, and uncertainty and anxiety, and fear of recurrence, and more chemo shits. And people say positivity helps? I just woke up with severe cramping diarrhea at 4:30 am, dripping blood in the toilet, shaking from pain. I don’t feel positive. I resent hearing “happy” New Year. It’s not. Fuck 2024 and fuck 2025.

I’m thinking ahead to the surgery. Does anyone have suggestions for products they feel eased the mastectomy process? Special pillows, bras or other clothes, or ice packs, scar-reducing oil, or what do I need to console myself?
