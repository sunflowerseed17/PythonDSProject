I had surgery on November 13 lumpectomy and sentinel note removal, I am set to start my four chemo treatments in a few weeks ever since I was diagnosed. I have felt like complete and utter garbage every day and I was just wondering if anybody else is feeling that way because of the mental toll this is taking on them? I am taking Ativan right now and that does help. I tried Lexapro. It made me very sick so I couldn’t take it. I’m having to force myself to eat, it just sucks because I’m EXHAUSTED from the mental toll.
