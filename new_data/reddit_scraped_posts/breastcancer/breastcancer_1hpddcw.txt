Has any one ever heard of 'High Definition Hair' (https://www.highdefinitionhair.com/)

I'm looking to purchase something easy (I don't do anything with  my hair besides pull it back with a clip) that looks very real, and stumbled upon this company. I was quoted between $5000 and $6000 dollars. Is that standard?

They tout their "no install" aspect, but I know nothing about wigs and therefore don't know if all others require some sort of install or whether this is a normal price for such a thing. It seems like...a lot (I'd be lucky to be considered lower middle class).

My insurance will reimburse $1,500 and I have $3,300 in my FSA, but that potentially leaves another $1,200 and also eats up my FSA for the entire year.

If this is if the going rate I'll suck it up, but if not can someone point me innthe right direction? I plan on wearing a wig when I'm at work and at my second job (tutoring) and potentially around my young niece/nephew, as well as for more formal outings. I know a lot of people say they don't really end up wearing the wig(s) they bought, but right now not being perceived as "sick" is important for my mental health and I'm very much wanting to do this.

TL;DR is $5000-$6000 for a custom wig expensive, has anyone heard of/have experience with high definition hair, and does anyone have recommendations for custom wig companies that are cheaper but as realistic looking?
