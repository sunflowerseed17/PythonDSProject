Hi all,

I had a DMX in May, chemo from July to September and 25 rounds of radiation through all of October, ending Nov. 5th. I had some mild burning from radiation, but no pain or anything that seemed concerning, until now.

I am almost 2 months post radiation, and for about the past 7-10 days I've had pain in my neck, collarbone area and sort of in my throat. More so on my right (cancer) side but also some on the left. It's like a dull, constant aching, and sometimes feels like there's a lump in my throat.

Could this be related to radiation? Could it be cancer spread? Has anyone had something similar? What did it turn out to be for you?

Thanks in advance.
