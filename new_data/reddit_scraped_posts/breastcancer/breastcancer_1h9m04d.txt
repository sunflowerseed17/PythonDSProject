Has anyone else has a chemo rash that is ONLY on their fingers? The hand and foot thing is supposed to be on the palms and soles of the feet. These are little red dots on my fingers of both hands. I showed the MO last week - I have steroid cream - but it’s just weird. Not really itchy and not painful - but let’s add one more thing to make me look weird right now!!!!
