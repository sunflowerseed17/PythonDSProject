After reading up on oncotype testing I’m wondering: how common it is for an oncotype score be low enough avoid chemo for ID ++- cancers? 

I’m 46 years old, diagnosed with IDC, ER/PR+, HER2-, grade 2, Stage II. The tumor is in the right breast only, at least 10 mm in length. According to the ultrasound and MRI, no indication of spread to the lymph nodes.  

I’ll be having surgery first and they’ll test for an oncotype score

During my initial visit, it was my impression that the oncologist was confident that chemotherapy would be a part of my treatment after surgery. She said that I could likely expect 4 rounds of chemo over 12 weeks. She also briefly explained hormone blocking medication after chemo. 
She didn’t discuss details about how oncotype scoring would impact treatment. 

I’m wondering what other aspects of my biopsy results could be indicating to the oncologist that chemo is likely? (Tumor size?) Or is the necessity of chemo actually uncertain until the oncotype is scored after surgery? 

I reached out to my Clinic NP with this question, but I thought I’d also seek input and experience here as well.
