I was ER+ and  Her2+, IDC, stage 2, grade 3 on my left breast with clear lymph nodes and did 6 rounds of TCHP before my surgery. I had a Lumpectomy in Oct'24 and finished my 20 sessions of radiation after that. After chemotherapy pathology from the lumpectomy showed I ended up with a mass left over, with clear lymph nodes and clear margins. I started my Kadcyla treatment with 14 sessions (every 3 weeks apart) where my 1st session went very well which they did at a slow pace of 1.5 hrs, but from 2nd session, they went with a fast pace of only 30 mins and I had a very bad reaction and they had to stop the session in the middle as even the pain medication didn't help. They tried the 3rd session with pre-med pain medication and at a slow pace of 1.5 hrs but had a pretty bad reaction after the session this time and had to go to the emergency department.

Now, my oncologist is saying that we cannot go with Kadcyla and will have to switch to Herceptin and Perjeta. Pls, advise what will be the impact (on reoccurrence) from switching back to Herceptin and Perjeta having had residual cancer. My oncologist is just saying that we do not have a choice now but isn't giving me any details of what the impact would be as she might be trying not to scare me.
