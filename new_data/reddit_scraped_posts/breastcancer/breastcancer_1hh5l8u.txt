I’m an NPR nerd (tote bag/coffee mug carrying type) and this just popped up as I scrolled languidly today, just looking for some reading to pass the time. 

I’ve seen so many posts about this here, and I’ve experienced it myself. I thought I’d share, since apparently it’s a common thing (and likely why this is one of the busiest subs I’ve been an active part of). 

The young lady the piece focuses on has NH Lymphoma but additional stories and links within the article lead to BC cancer inclusive stories.

I feel so deeply grateful to be part of this sisterhood we’ve all been unceremoniously engulfed in, and remain amazed at the power of social media when used with the intention of kindness, compassion, strength and support.
