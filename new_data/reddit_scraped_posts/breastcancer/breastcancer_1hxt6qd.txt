Did any of you have this and what did it end up being caused by?

Of course worried it is mets? but hoping it’s just something related to nerves or my expander… I am 4 months post mastectomy, and it’s on the mastectomy/expander side. It doesn’t feel like sore muscular pain, but rather like shooting electrical pain that last about 10 seconds. 

Thanks for sharing any experience with this !
