I was just wondering, where does double mastectomy rank in terms of pain and recovery time versus other surgery such as hip replacement or other cancer?

Sorry I should have clarified I had a DMX with immediate recon. I was wondering how it compares since I recovered pretty quickly. I was up and moving the next day. I have some people complaining they feel like they are dying with a fractured bone. So just wondering how they compared. I have a high pain tolerance.
