I had a unilateral mastectomy. I would like to have deep flap reconstruction with some enhancements (I was a smaller a cup). My surgeon said he could do it and would use liposuction to enhancement my existing breast to match the other. Has anyone in here done thus? As time goes on and I lose or gain weight will they become uneven? Will my body reabsorb the liposuction area? Will it really look even?
