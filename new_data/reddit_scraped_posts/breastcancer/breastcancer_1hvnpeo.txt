Specifically, stage 1 with negative nodes. I’ve read a bunch of studies that focused on N0 population and found that with further testing (for whatever reason), distant mets were found in about 1% of the patients. Thus, reclassifying them as dnMBC.

Obviously, with my full body CT results coming up in 2 days I’m completely fixated on the 1% and not the 99%. Popping anti-anxiety pills all day long doesn’t seem to touch my spiral. To be fair, I have a lifelong health anxiety.
