I was diagnosed with DCIS in 12/2022, and had a double mastectomy with immediate reconstruction in 2/2023. Due to having Psoriasis I was told that saline implants would be the safest option, but as a thin woman they have always appeared very ripply, even after 2 fat transfers. Now one of my implants has shifted and looks very odd, and my plastic surgeon says the whole procedure needs to be redone. I am not sure I even want to go through all this again, and am wondering if anyone has experience with explant surgery and going flat after reconstruction?
