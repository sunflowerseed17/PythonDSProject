I’m on day 19/20 of my radiation treatment, which means I was going every day this week. My breast is so red it’s brown, I’m blistered and itchy beyond belief. But I still had to put on the Christmas magic for my family and my young children. I went to
Christmas parties and smiled and handed out gifts, all wincing and itching because it literally hurts just to wear clothes. 

I think because you can’t see any of my pain then people assume I’m fine. I still have my hair and I worked full time through it all (only because I don’t have any sick time left). I told people about my diagnosis so long ago, I think a lot of them forgot. No one asked about my treatment. 

I don’t know where I’m going with this, just that I feel like I’m so isolated and alone. I didn’t sleep well at all last night and this morning I’m feeling just low.
