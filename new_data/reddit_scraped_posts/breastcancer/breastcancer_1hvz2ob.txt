Hi everyone, 

I had DCIS and had a lumpectomy the week of Thanksgiving. The results and edges came back clear and other than dealing with seroma for the last month (ugh!) I am now being referred out to a radiation oncologist and a medical oncologist. 

My appointment with the Rad Onc is tomorrow. What questions would you ask? My breast surgeon had actually said he doesn't think I need radiation but he wanted me to meet with the doctor anyway just to be sure. 

I didn't have any kind of mass, only calcifications, after 2 abnormal mammograms and biopsy, so that's why the lumpectomy was done. I'm not sure what to ask or how to say "my doctor didn't even think radiation was needed, so tell me the benefits?"

Help?
