I'm wondering if anyone found out about support groups from their oncologist and went? What was your experience? 
I'm kind of in a delayed situation. Diagnosed as DCIS and had lumpectomy during Thanksgiving week. Wound up with seroma when the stitches came out and I'm still dealing with packing the wound ND taping each day. I go back tomorrow and he's supposed to refer me to a med oncologist who will manage estrogen blockers and maybe radiation. I don't need chemo, which is a blessing, but I've been dealing with a leaky boob for over a month and I still have an open wound that hasn't healed so I can't go swimming or any other activities I enjoy. 
I feel alone in this.
