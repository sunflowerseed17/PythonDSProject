My case is complex, I was diagnosed with TNBC 19 days ago. Images and even after surgery there was not indication of cancer. My surgeon wanted to removed my "benign biopsied" lump because it was growing, and no one wants anything growing inside. But when patÃ³logy results came  as cancer. 

So it's TN, 1.6cm T1c stage 2 with a loooooow ki67 5%.

Everything I have read puts me in the verge of having chemo and not having it. But my biggest concern is how they will determine if the treatment is successful if there is not a tumor inside me that will define pcr. 

Also I the low ki67, seems it's good because means is not growing fast but can be less effective to chemo. It's not a lot of research for my case. 

I'm going crazy!!! ðŸ˜£
