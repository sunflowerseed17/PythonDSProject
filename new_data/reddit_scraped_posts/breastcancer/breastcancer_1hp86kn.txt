Hey everyone. I was diagnosed with breast cancer at 26 yo in 2022 (+++). 
I went through two surgeries, mastectomy of my left breast and Chemotherapy which had to be stopped because my liver was sufferin heavily under the medicals.
I'm currently taking letrozole and Other medicals that Put me in to Menopause.

The diagnosis and the Treatment changed everything for me. I'm constantly tired, feel overwhelmed easily, gained a Lot of wheigt and I'm very afraid of my furure.

I was never Sure if I really want Kids but now as my Friends are having children, there ist a small voice inside me that whispers "what If you cant" and even If I can have Kids - do I really want to risk having the pregnancy and getting Cancer again Just for my Kids to possibly live without their mother?
On the Other Hand I dont want to regret Not having Kids once I'm older..

My husband went through all of this with me and He Says He is fine with everything. He has been nothing but supportive throughout the diagnosis. But I feel my sickness Not only robbs me of everything but also hin. I somehow feel guilty that we have to ask ourselves these questions because of my sickness. 

Does anyone feel the Same?
