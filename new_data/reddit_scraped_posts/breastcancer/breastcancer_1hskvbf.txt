Dear Warriors,

I just wanted to get a sense how common it is for lumpectomy patients who have received radiation therapy and had during their surgery a:

a) sentinel lymph node dissection (where they inject you with blue dye into your breast before the surgery)

and/or

b) oncoplastic2 surgery (where they replace/displace your breast tissue to even out the breast)

how you did with radiation?

Did you get any breast and/or arm swelling? I would appreciate hearing your experiences as I'm nervous having undergone these procedures. Thank you
