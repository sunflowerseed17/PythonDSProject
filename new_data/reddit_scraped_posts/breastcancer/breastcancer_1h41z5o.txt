Hi everyone I bought these breaded chicken steaks on Tuesday Nov 26. I opened the pack that night and we had 2 for dinner.

The due date was Thursday nov 28th.

 It is now Sunday Dec 1st - so 2 days past due date but has been open for 5ish days.

It’s reconstituted chicken ( not sure if that makes a difference) it was in coldest part of fridge. It doesn’t smell bad or look odd

… was going to cook it today. What do you think?
