Dear Ladies, I was recently diagnosed with ALH (Atypical Lobular Hyperplasia) along with a small (1 cm) breast cancer in the same breast. The cancer was diagnosed first and then an MRI and MRI-biopsy confirmed the separate ALH area in the same breast. 

Have any of you dealt with ALH plus breast cancer? How was it treated? 

I'll be meeting with my doctors to discuss treatment, but I had never even heard of ALH until yesterday. Thank you.
