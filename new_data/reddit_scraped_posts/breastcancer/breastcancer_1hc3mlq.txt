Hi everyone  - I had my second SMX + expanders put in back in October. 

The left breast had cancer and that was chemo + SMX flat close last year + six weeks radiation. The right breast was preventive and skin-sparing. They actually put an expander in my left side! But haven’t expanded it yet. 

Next surgery will be the DIEP reconstruction. I’m potentially starting a new job and I’ve been transparent about the surgery. 

ANYWAY…my question is: for my corporate brethren who work from home, how long after DIEP did you really need to take off before logging back in?
