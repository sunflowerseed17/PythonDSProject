In October of 2023, I was diagnosed with IDC, ++- in my left breast. I had an MRI in November that showed nothing more in left or in nodes or on right. I had surgery, chemo (stage 1 but high risk of reoccurrence based on EndoPredict test), and radiation. Just started Anastrozole about 6 weeks ago. I have Fibromyalgia so my doctor wanted to take things one step at a time because everything was making my Fibromyalgia worse. Funny enough, the AI has been a nothing burger. 

So because radiation finished in September, I only had a mammogram on the right side. Well, here we go again, I have a call back for a diagnostic and ultrasound on right side due to posterior architectural changes. Of course I cannot get in till 1/22. 

I know it is probably nothing or at worst, I guess DCIS because the MRI showed nothing last year. I doubt it has reoccurred when I was in treatment all year and lymph node was clear so that would be one lucky cancer cell to evade surgery, chemo, and radiation and establish on the other side. 

Has anyone dealt with something similar? By that I mean either a separate cancer at next mammogram, reoccurrence, or nothing following a call back?
