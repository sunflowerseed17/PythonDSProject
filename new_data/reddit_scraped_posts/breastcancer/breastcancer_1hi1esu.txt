Just left the breast surgeons office for my initial visit into what I can only describe as a  Rollercoaster.  With what I thought was IDC and Mets to atleast one axillary node now looks to be IBC as well.  The hits just keep coming.   I guess it's better then the unknown.  But, fuck, im already beaten down and I haven't even started anything.  MRI Monday, oncologist next Friday, port placement following Friday then to start what seems to be the real monster of them all TCHP. Surgery later, than more than likely radiation... How do you all do it? How do ypu face it?  I'm reading posts about side effects and I'm struggling already... ðŸ˜ª
