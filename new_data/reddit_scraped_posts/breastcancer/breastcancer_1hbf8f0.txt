I was supposed to start my first round of kadcyla today but was sent home due to low blood counts. I finished my 4th round of AC on 11/12 so it’s been 4 weeks and my counts had been bouncing back after 2 weeks while on AC. I’m bummed because I wanted to get going to get this over with sooner (going to take a year to get through and that’s with no more hiccups like this). Anyone have this issue with AC recovery? My absolute neuts were 0.36 so really low, I’m usually in the 5.0 range after 2 weeks. Trying again next week but my doctor didn’t seem super hopeful that they’d be back up by then. Any tips or tricks to get them back up?
