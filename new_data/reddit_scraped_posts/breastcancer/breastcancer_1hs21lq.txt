I know I already posted, but I was doing so well up until the news that there was cell area in my brain that could be metastatic.  I’m stage 1a.    ++-   I had lumpectomy in October and just finished radiation.  I was feeling so hopeful to move on.  My ribs were feeling sore and as I’m nervous about everything,  my doctor ordered a bone scan.  

I was just really hoping for peace of mind to move forward.  But the finding in my frontal lobe has me so scared and depressed.  It’s hard for me to get out of bed today.  Tomorrow I will have a ct scan to look into it.  My doctor said the likelihood of it being cancer is very very low.  But she wants to make sure it’s okay.  I just keep expecting to be told I have months to live.  I’m just so over this fear.  It really kicked me down.  

I’ve been trying to look up stage 1a breast cancer metastasizing to the brain.   I think I could be that rare statistic that it happened. I can’t get over this fear.
