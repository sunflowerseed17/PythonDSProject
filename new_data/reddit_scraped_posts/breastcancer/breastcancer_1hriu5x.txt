Anyone else feel nervous about the fact there are shelves above the crib? ðŸ˜‚ I initially had the large storybooks under the end table with the plant and lamp on top of it, but the books have to go on top, so I had to move the lamp to the hexagonal shelves. I didnâ€™t want to put anything that could hurt baby in the direct line of the crib so I moved things so I could at least put the lamp more to the side. 

Baby death trap!!!
