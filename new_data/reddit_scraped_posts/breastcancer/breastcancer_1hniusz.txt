So, my bewbz were filleted and what’s left is all bound up in an ACE bandage “corset”.  Surgeon told me multiple times I’d be given a mastectomy bra to transition into.  Did not happen.  When I had asked this morning, assistant told me to “just order one on Amazon”.

Erm … I have zero idea what size.  I only know it needs to hook and secure outside via zipper.  No Velcro.

Reconstruction Expander won’t happen until I heal.  And, if necessary, will get a week of chemo before hormone therapy starts.

HALP !  Former size was a wireless pullover Bali bra XL/40C.  No idea what I am dealing with under the bandage, but need the firm support bra when the bandage comes off.  There literally needs to be someone in place to help us figure out what size to order before bandages come off.  Way before.  Like, before heading home after surgery.

Thank you in advance for any advice.

PS:  Anyone waiting on their surgery date … I highly recommend the travel pillow that straps on and around (mine has a minky dot cover), seatbelt cushion that comes with some, and a drain apron.  My hubby thought the apron was overkill until he had to unpin/pin for clothing changes, sticking himself multiple times.  (If you choose to pin, get DIAPER PINS and wear soft and more open-weave shirts, like flannel.  Apron is really handy though.  And, pain can be managed.  Don’t be a “hero” like me.  I asked for Tylenol #3 and should’ve accepted an OxyContin prescription.  Hurting on a Friday with only 6 pills left.  Breakthrough pain 3-4 hrs after.  Takes an hour to kick in, but doesn’t take pain away.  Trying to get to surgeon through assistant is a PITB.  Hopefully, she will see it before the end of the day.  🙄

CHECK WALMART FOR MARKED-DOWN PJs THAT BUTTON UP.  I was able to find a bunch of minky-soft, button-up PJs for $8/pr.  They are Christmas-themed, but who even cares ?!  They are comfy and not too hot.  If my drains leak or I spill food/drink on them, they were a cheap investment.  This summer, I can turn into a shorts set with help from a family member who has a serger.  I can use again for reconstruction surgeries !
