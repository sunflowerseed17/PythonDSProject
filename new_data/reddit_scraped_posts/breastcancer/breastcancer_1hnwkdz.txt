Hi all, I’ve just had my first AC infusion for TNBC about 10 days ago now and just got blood work done yesterday. My AST (57), ALT (86), and the one that is worrying me the most alkaline phosphatase (205) are all on the high side which I somewhat expected but didn’t anticipate to be this high. Has anyone else experienced this after AC chemo? What has helped you bring down the levels? I’ve already reached out to my doctor to see her recommendations on what to do about it as well, just wondering if anyone else has experienced this!
