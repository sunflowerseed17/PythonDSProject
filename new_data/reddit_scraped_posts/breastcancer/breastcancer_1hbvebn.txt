Honestly I'm not really even sure what to post here. My diagnosis is still fresh so I'm just in a place of overwhelm and trying not to spiral. 

I know that this is the most common type of breast cancer and I also know being +++  is not the most favorable and also not the worst. I wish the her2 wasn't a 3+.... I guess that's what has me concerned that this is going to be more aggressive. Right now the plan is a lumpectomy with a port placement and Sentinel node biopsy next week. And then once I meet with oncology I'll be able to find out for sure what forms of chemo and hormone therapy I'm going to need. I'm still waiting on that appointment to be scheduled. I do have an appointment with the radiation oncologist on Friday. I would prefer to have the treatment start before the surgery so I can make sure they're actually going to work. But, I think my insurance is going to require the surgery first. 

Ironically enough, I am actually a hospice nurse right now. And I don't know if that's helping me or making things worse! I have a 2-year-old and a 6-year-old. I'm concerned about work and finances and my kids. I don't know how to get my brain to stop fixating on this. I'm fine for a while and then I just break down. My fiance is difficult to deal with on a good day so trying to get some support from him right now is hard. I technically got my diagnosis yesterday and I actually had to ask him to give me a hug. But that's a whole post on its own

Like I said, I'm not really even sure what to ask in this post. I just feel like I need reassurance or clarification. Any advice?! I've included the biopsy report in case there's anything helpful there
