Good morning, friends! I am going to be starting my TCHP treatment this week and was curious on if those that have been through it took snacks to eat throughout the day while getting their infusions? I am going to be cold capping so I know that I am going to be constantly busy and my husband who will be helping me cap will be busy as well. I am just trying to plan ahead and be as prepared as one can be for this situation. Thanks in advance! ðŸ’•
