Hello again! Hope everyone is finding the strength to get through this. I have my 5th chemo tomorrow. They're switching to AC. I'm scared. I'm tired of being poked at. I was having a fun week and I'm not ready to be stomped down again. I know what to expect from AC thanks to this subreddit. When I asked my oncologist if I should expect any different side-effects or something, he said - if I asked you if you like peas more or cauliflower, you won't be able to answer me. Similarly this effects everyone differently. And my mouth was gaping and my mind was like - ??? I couldn't even process but later I found it hilarious. He gave a better analogy after that. I don't know what I would have done if this subreddit didn't exist coz my oncologist is ....kooky. Aight, wish me luck!
