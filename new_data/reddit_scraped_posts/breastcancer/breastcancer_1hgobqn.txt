Ok so going into round 4 of AC chemo.  Resting heart rate is up. Bad days hovering around 100, but laying down resting its 70-90s, 60s during sleep. BUT if I just walk down the hall or stand up it shoots to 140 or higher . 150 going up stairs 
Pe has been ruled out.  Ecg x3 are ok. 
So my question. Did anyone have high heart rate on AC chemo and it turned out to be ok in the long run? 
Thanks
