The biopsy results demonstrated invasive ductal carcinoma.  Grade 3 of 3.  Estrogen receptor positive.  Progesterone receptor positive.  HER2 Neu positive.

Surgery hasn't been scheduled since I have all my consults done first...Radiation oncologist,  hematology oncologist,  plastic surgeon, and then I'll meet with him (surgeon) and tell him what my decision is.
