I only know the diagnosis and not what treatments I’ll get yet which is why I’m posting ….. I have to wait till 3rd January for their multidisciplinary meeting to put all the bits together … I’d like to have an idea of what happens with bone only mets.
Lobular breast cancer 43mm ++- awaiting formal pathology back (radiotherapy to come) 
Nuclear bone scan - area of mets on lumbar 3 (possibly also pelvis not sure yet) 
It’s the bone I’m most concerned about. 

Anyone else ?
