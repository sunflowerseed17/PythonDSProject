I get at least two a day to my cellphone.  It doesn't ring - just goes to voicemail, same spiel, different well-spoken American female, different caller ID each time.

I know I don't owe back taxes and I know not to engage these scammers - I'm just tired of having to delete multiple voicemails a day.  Would calling and accepting their invitation to be removed from their list be helpful, or is it just better to keep ignoring and removing?
