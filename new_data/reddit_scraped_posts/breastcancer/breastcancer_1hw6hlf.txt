Hi all,

37F, ++-, diagnosed 10/30, DCIS and IDC. Had lumpectomy on 12/13, two nodes removed, and just had my post op meeting with my surgeon today. I'm early stage 2, grade 3.

Good news - clean margins, no further surgery needed

Bad news - one node tested positive for IDC (4 mm), and I got told that (even without an oncotype score) I'll most likely need chemo due to the high grade and node involvement,

Meeting with radiation onco next week, waiting for call back from medical onco to set up meeting. 

Had been hoping to avoid chemo...I just feel so down right now. I take IV immunosuppressant meds for another chronic condition and I just feel like I'm doomed to a slashed lifespan.

Could use some encouragement.
