I see my oncologist tomorrow to confirm the plan care at this point. I was upgraded to a Stage 2 after MRI (though this was done after my biopsy so I'm questioning the upgraded size). I have IDC with some DCIS, +++, last measurement is 2.5cm. Anyway the regimen has changed to TCHP and I wanted to find out what side effects to expect. Can you share your experiences? Am I going to lose all my hair, nausea, vomiting, neuropathy, etc etc. I know it's not going to be fun, but I'd like to be somewhat forwarded as doctor's generally don't give the full rundown of side effects. I have 2 little ones- one in Daycare and one in 1st grade so staying away from germs is going to be challenging. I also am a hospice nurse so I travel to people's houses- some of this will be adjusted as I go through treatments. I also have to do 18 treatments rather than 12 *sigh*. I really just want off this Rollercoaster. I also have a whole battery of tests still to do and trying to wait on all of this stuff and schedule everything is driving me crazy! I'm scared that this is spreading we're just ho-humming along with scheduling everything!

Anyway, back to the question- can you share your experience with TCHP and any advice on dealing with side effects and getting through this in general??

Thank you!
