Just a random fun fact. I lost all my eyebrows, last time I had chemo. I was supposed to have chemo again already but my blood values are too low so I am having a longer break. And I can see my eyebrows already growing back out with some baby hairs, with only 1.5 week extra break! 

Although I know those will fall off again soon, it's nice to see the little hairs come back in anyways. Its nice to know that the body I remember is still there.
