First post, months long lurker so I’m sorry if I didn’t do flair correctly. I am currently 2 wks
 s/p dmx w/ expanders. I read my pathology from the surgery today shows nothing but fibrous tissue on the opposite side, no lymphnode infiltration however it does say I have a clear margin with less than 1mm clear as well as lobular extension into the biopsy site. For those who have had DCIS is there a distance the oncologist will want for margins? Am I looking at more treatment other than tamoxifen and oophorectomy in a few months. I worry about reoccurrence later on.
