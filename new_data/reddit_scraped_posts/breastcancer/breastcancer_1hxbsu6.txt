36 years started at 35. Well started January of last year. Actually today is the day I got my biopsy last year. But anyways  I’m stage 4 TNBC. Did 21 chemos 22 keytruda and counting lol , a lumpectomy and now I will start 28 sessions of radiation. 


I thought I was only getting it on my breast and armpit but now I found out my neck. I went on a dark rabbit hole that said radiation on neck will cause your voice to change, sore throat and a bunch of stuff. If you had it please some tips and some pointers of what lotion to use or what to do with neck radiation would be helpful! I just had my appointment yesterday where they molded me and I did a cut scan. I start on Tuesday. They prescribed me medication lotion. Doc said use something with no fragrance like a baby lotion? But will that be enough?

 I’m pretty much freaking out, I feel like I shouldn’t because of all I went through but here I am. 

 Aaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh 😮‍💨😬
