Just beginning this journey. I am in Los Angeles area. I have been to 3 different centers and surgeons. At first all I had was a biopsy done with and ultrasound which was DCIS. Then two of the surgeons saw a dark spot and wanted another mammogram and ultrasound. It came back from a different center as another spot 4MM on the mammogram. (The first center did not show it) She wanted to do another biopsy. Instead I had a MRI which came back as linear areas in both breasts. Now I have to have biopsies in both breasts. Originally all 3 were just going to do a lumpectomy and not go further with testing. I guess my question is what if I just did that and no MRI was done. These areas that have shown up on the MRI when would have that been an issue? A recurrence? Since I would have already had this simple surgery, now what would have happened, this is the most confusing to me.
