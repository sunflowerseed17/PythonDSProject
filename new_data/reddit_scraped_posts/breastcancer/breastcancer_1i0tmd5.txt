I'm trying not to lose my mind tonight.  I start my first TCHP chemo treatment tomorrow.   I was supposed to start last week but it got delayed due to weather.   Because of the delay my husband is out of the country and can't be with me.  This wonderful support community has me more prepared with everything I think I could possibly need, but my mind and mental state is an absolute mess.  I'm always the strong one, the one everyone goes too to hold them up.  I can't do that for myself and tonight has been an absolute struggle.  I did ask for meds to help and my ONC graciously gave me something to help, so I will take that shortly.  

What did everyone do to overcome the overwhelming feelings? I feel like I'm in a glass box watching all my friends just go on about their daily lives while I am screaming and no one cares or even hears me.... ðŸ˜«
