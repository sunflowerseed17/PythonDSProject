Hello! Wondering for those who did TC chemo and cold capped (especially with Penguin), when did you start to see the regrowth come in? Asking since the expense and effort of the capping is supposed to make hair come back faster and thicker (even after I lost most of it).

I'm done with 3 rounds of TC chemo and have my fourth next week. I've been cold capping with Penguin because it was supposed to be the best, the coldest, etc. We even hired their professional cappers. 

Alas, during the predictable big shed window 14-21 days after my first infusion, most of my hair came out. I followed all the many strict rules. I wasn't expecting it so it was still long and full ðŸ˜” By now, two months and 3 rounds later, I have almost nothing left and just got it cut to remove the long scraggly strings. Looks terrible and I'm wearing hats and maybe will start wearing wigs. 

Every day I look at my scalp and armpits hoping to see some hair come in. When might it start? I was hopeful when I read for some people it starts before the end of chemo.
