I had a PET scan in September that showed my 2 lung nodules decreased by more than half and were no longer hypermetabolic. My Signatera was also negative. I just got the results of my CT scan and it shows that one of the nodules has increased significantly. It was 9mm in September and is now measuring 7.5 x 6.3 x 6.7 cm. My Signatera is also 307. My oncologist mentioned that it looks like the Trodelvy is working everywhere else, I guess the other nodules is gone, but this one is growing and I need to do another biopsy so they can take a closer look at it and see what options are available.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? What was your next step? I've already done taxol/carbo, AC, Keytruda,  Capecitabine, radiation, and surgery when I was stage 1. I am BRACA negative.

Thank you!!!
