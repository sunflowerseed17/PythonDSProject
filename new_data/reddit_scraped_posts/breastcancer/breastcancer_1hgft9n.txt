I was diagnosed with breast cancer in September 2024 (++-) and went through several rounds of biopsies to investigate various "areas of concern" found on the MRI. Now that all the biopsy results are back, I am meeting with my surgeon to discuss a treatment plan later today. I was doing really well mentally these last few weeks and now I'm completely freaking out. Somehow I think I was pretending it wasn't really REAL and now I have to accept that it's really happening. Anyway, thank you for letting me vent. Any words of wisdom are appreciated. Love you guys!
