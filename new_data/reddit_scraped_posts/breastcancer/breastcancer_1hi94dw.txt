Well, upgraded from Stage 1 to 2 and might possibly be Stage 3. MRI showed the mass was larger than they thought (ultrasound estimated 1.2cm, biopsy said 0.6cm). MRI says 2.5cm. But there is a 13cm area of enhancement  that may or may not be disease...but I'm terrified. Good news is the lymphnodes didn't light up. However, there is a lymphnode under my breastbone- she says it appears normal, just happens to be visible. Also a spot on the left breast- but they think it's benign (fibroadenoma vs lymphnode). 

So, no longer struggling with lumpectomy vs mastectomy- that decision was made for me. DmX, here I come. The area of enhancement extends to just outside the nipple so probably can't do nipple-sparing mastectomy 

Also switched from surgery first to chemo first, which is fine. At least I'll be able to tell if the meds are working.

I just don't want this to be worse than what it already is. I'm frustrated and terrified and paranoid. Every little bit of discomfort to my neck, back, etc makes me think it's in my bones. Dr says she'd be very surprised if it'sanywhere but the breast. But we went from, it's probably nothing to Stage 2 pretty fast. I'm 46 with a 2yo and 6yo and a not so supportive SO. A lot of great friends and family but inside the house is stressful- which doesn't help with a hormone-driven cancer (and an autoimmune thyroid disease)

Is this thing growing this fast or is it just that they're getting clearer pictures and more info????

Next up is staging scans, bone scan and port placement. Talking to my MO tomorrow to see if this changes the medication plan.
