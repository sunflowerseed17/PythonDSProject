I am not sure if Letrozole is causing my insomnia issues, but whenever I wake up at night I immediately have a hot flash followed by a few cold flashes because I am covered in sweat and get chilled. I donâ€™t have this problem when I can sleep through the night and am looking for recommendations to help. I also have trouble falling asleep and have been going to sleep later and waking up later - not great for my job though I am WFH over the holidays. It will be rough waking up early again in January.

I live in Ontario where weed is legal and am wondering which type of gummy product is best for sleep. The ones I am using (gummy pearls) now are not very effective: 8 mg CBN, 2 mg THC and less than a mg of CBD.

Does anyone have a different formulation that helps?

Thanks!
