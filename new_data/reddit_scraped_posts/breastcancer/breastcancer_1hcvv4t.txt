As I am nearing my PET scan date, I feel like I am attracted to stupid junk food that I've been trying to avoid for the entirety of my chemo. I keep craving sweets and fried food and stuff I am not supposed to put in my body. And then I start feeling guilty and worried. I just miss being able to eat normally like I used to, before this pandemonium which is my cancer diagnosis. 

I just had a piece of chocolate cake at 2 am and I am not able to sleep because my stomach is burninnnnggggg. And I know a piece of cake won't hurt but these cravings are only getting worse now and I have no control over myself anymore. I don't know whether to laugh or cry and I don't even know why I am posting this here it makes no absolute sense whatsoever.
