Has anybody ever experienced a very weird, sharp, sensitive muscle or ligament pain on their upper chest a few inches from the lymph node removal site 6 weeks after surgery? It almost feels like a little bump or swollen ligament just under the surface of the skin, or in the muscle. It hurts to touch it and it feels better when I move my shoulder forward and then rub The entire chest with my flat hand. I feel like it could be a pulled ligament or a muscle. I hope. Just wondering if this is common?
