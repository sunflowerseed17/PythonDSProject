I just got my mastectomy surgery scheduled for later this month . Even though logically I knew what this would entail and went to the plastic surgeon and happily discussed expanders, radiation..etc…I’m really sad . Im sad at the upcoming loss of my breast and sensation in it and symmetry. I know Ill do reconstruction but my natural one is me, its always been there and its nice and pretty. Im devastated but I can’t cry and I’m not sure why . Like I’ll feel the tears come and then they disappear. I’m not sure if it’s just from shock after shock of dealing with this treatment and harrowing process . I just don’t know if things will feel right it again and I don’t want to lose my breast- even though it’s gone rogue and wants to kill me . I don’t have a choice though and will obviously go through with the surgery , it’s just hard .
