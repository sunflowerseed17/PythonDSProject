Guys I need some suggestions. Our Dane HATES wearing his booties and the last couple years he literally just won't go on na walk if we put them on. We try not to take him when it's below -10 anyways.. but he's almost 8 and I think he's more sensitive. 
We live in a winter city and he has a big coat and we use muttluks but I think we need an alternative.

He is bigger than average.
