Hello sisterhood - I had two separate SMXs. First one (cancer side) in Sep 2023 on the left side, two lymph nodes removed. Second one this past October, skin sparing on right side, 3 lymph nodes removed (apparently they just came out with the tissue). 

Ever since my right mastectomy, my *left* knee and ankle will get slightly swollen sometimes. And today I got out of the shower and noticed my veins on my *left* arm (like bicep and chest and crook of elbow) looked like someone drew on me with blue marker. 

Obviously Iâ€™ll ask my surgeon, but wanted to know if anyone experienced this? Could it be a precursor to lymphedema?
