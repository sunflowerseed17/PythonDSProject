I am a 38F with HR+ and Her2- multifocal IDC, two invasive tumors that are 1.4cm and 1 tiny 1mm invasive tumor along with extensive DCIS. On the initial biopsy I was rated as grade 1 with a high ER percentage and an even higher PR percentage. My ki67 was only 10. 

After my dmx my pathology report had some surprises. I am now grade 2 (miotic rate of 2). I had a micromet in one of two lymph nodes taken. But to me, most surprising of all I had extensive LVI. Before surgery I had an MRI which showed an inter mammory lymph node light up which my surgeon assumed to be an incidental finding, but with a positive node and LVI it makes me wonder!

I am awaiting my Oncotype score and assume it will be low due to my low ki67 and high PR positivity. I have not met with medical oncology yet. My surgeon believes that I will now require radiation but did anyone who was premenopausal require chemo for node positive and extensive LVI despite oncotype score?
