Greetings of the season! We will get through it, and I hope, with some grace.  

I am four and a half weeks out from my partial mastectomy and SLNB.  I was told I could take the binder off after three weeks, which I did.  I still wear the zip up compression bras but due to cording, by mid day, they cause me a lot of discomfort. Questions: how long did you wear your binder? When did you change to a regular bra? And if you did not sleep in a bra prior to surgery, did you start to do so after?   I have lighter weight sleep bras but they too chafe under my arms and I really need a break unless I am hurting myself for other reasons by not wearing a bra to bed.   Would love some suggestions.  I have my second PT today
