35 then, 37 now - Dx Oct 23 with ++- 2A, grade 2, 4.2cm IDC, node neg, oncotype 27, lumpectomy and re-excision and clear margins, 6xTC and 21xRads and since June 2024 on exemestane and monthly lucrin and kisqali, no significant side effects.

I am half a year into kisqali and I feel so confident in my body and recovery at this point. Those drugs are slowly starving off any last cancer cells - if they're not already all gone. I will be brand spanking new in 2025 ladies. 

I spent so many nights wondering if I was gonna die and reading studies and stats over and over. I don't need to obsess over any of that anymore - it's just not rational. I am healthy and cured, I literally did all the stuff and I am moving on with my life. Sure I have moments but I am at a point where it only takes me minutes to let go of those thoughts. It objectively is unlikely that I'll ever deal with this shit again given my treatment schedule and drug tolerance.

Wishing everyone a healing end to 2024! I'm ready to step into my new life in 2025 yall! Slap some hair extensions in when the pixie cut has grown out a bit more and get a new pair of boobs and take lots of trips! Who else is with me?!
