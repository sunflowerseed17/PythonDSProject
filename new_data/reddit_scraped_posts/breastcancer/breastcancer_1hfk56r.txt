A friend shared Finch in her IG stories, and it's become a daily anchoring routine to keep me sane, a day after an ultrasound found a lump in my breast (November 14).   
Since then, I've been diagnosed with triple positive breast cancer, had my work insurance change terms (boo), switched hospitals because of said insurance and this week I'll have my first visit with my oncologist.  
It's been a challenging month but I'm grateful for Finch and my Finch friends. Like I still don't know who you are but exchanging virtual hugs and kudos really do perk my day up.  
Though at first, I was a bit overwhelmed with the Friends interactions but now I learned I don't have to respond to 5 interactions with 5 more, it's great.   
Self-care isn't overrated at all and sometimes, I really needed that 1 minute to breathe or repeat affirmations to take me out of my 'Oh god I have cancer' moments.  
Hugs to everyone on here!
