Hi team, club, whatever we are?! Am pretty new here, but know that AIs are in my future - 58, ++-, stage 1, grade 2
Am wondering if anyone has had much success working with a naturopath? I was on HRT until my diagnosis a month ago. It was a huge help for night sweats, brain fog, sleep issues and bone density. But it was also feeding my cancer so that sucks. Anyone made the switch and doing okay?
