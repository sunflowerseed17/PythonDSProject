48, premenopausal, ++-, had a DMX, Oncotype is 3 or 4 ( more on that later), Sentinel Nodes clear but oncologists are 50/50 on chemo vs. just  AI + Ribociclib. My oncologist is gathering more information to help me decide.

I was pretty sure I was getting out of this with just tamoxifen but...pathology showed intramammary lymph node involvement and extensive LVI. It's unclear if the tumor originated in the node, or elsewhere, my Dr. Order 2 Oncotype scores, one based on LN involvement, and one on none.

Anyone with a similar situation? What did you do? I am leaning toward the AI+Ribociclib and waiting to hear if radiation is recommended. I thought I was almost out of the woods with that low Oncotype. Thank you.
