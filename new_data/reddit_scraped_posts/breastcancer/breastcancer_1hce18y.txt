I’m struggling I have no idea what I’m doing this was just not on my radar.  I look like bozo bio hair around the perimeter, chemo taking its toll. I tried to keep it with cold cap because I like my hair it’s my safety net and it’s suffering. I don’t have the money to spend on a wig that would come with a fitting even the cancer center won’t do the fitting for free without a purchase. This was a donation. It’s heat resistant so they said. It looks enough like my hair. I have a small head and the cap fits good but how do u get this to stay on? It has no clips and I don’t want to clip anything to what’s left of my bio hair I’m trying to keep my clown hair. Any help you can provide would be appreciated. If you zoom in on this pic it’s the part line and that pokey hard lace thing. This isn’t it what lace front wigs look like that I have seen how do you hide that. Do I use a grip or a cap or glue what the hell am I doing?!! Holidays around rh corner I done even want to leave my house. At least I don’t need the hat with hair I still have what hair but I don’t want to wear a hat all day, I’m just not rocking the head scarf I would like some privacy and I need hair! Thank you!’
