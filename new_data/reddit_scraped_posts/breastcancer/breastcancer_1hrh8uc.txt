I feel like my body is fragile. I finished chemo in early July and I will be on Herceptin through May. I was diagnosed at 54 and was relatively healthy, regular exercise, no issues other than hypothryoid. I did 12 weeks of Taxol and really didn't struggle until 7/12 but it was never unmanageable and I was active throughout.  Two weeks after I finished radiation in September, I tore my retina and had to have surgery on my eye. In October, I sprained a ligament in my ankle (minor slip on stairwell) that still hasn't healed after 10 weeks. 

This doesn't not feel like my normal body. I realize that sounds stupid, of course it isn't, but I did not anticipate this. I've had a fair amount of emotional turmoil due to my long term partner leaving me right after my diagnosis, but I'm not a stranger to emotional turmoil. Could it be the chemo? Or am I randomly really unlucky?
