I was just about to give my baby girl a bath. And then I got the phone call.  You have cancer.

So many tears in the first months.  Rocking her to sleep and being her only parent (donor conceived) and knowing no oneâ€™s heart will ever explode like mine does for her.

(41F) in June I was diagnosed with TNBC with an estimate of Stage 1.  Because I was still lactating (I was 4.5 months postpartum) they werenâ€™t sure if the lump was 2cm or bigger.  After telling me to get ready for surgery in 3 weeks after diagnosis, 1 week before, they decided to flip it and do chemo first.

My oncologist was unusually confident. Saying it will be ok and I wonâ€™t have to look over my shoulder my whole life. She said I would only need 12 low dose infusions of taxol/carb (4 rounds).  Well, the first scan didnâ€™t look like much of a response.  But then things were tricky they said because this MRI wasnâ€™t with my lactating breasts. So itâ€™s hard to compare.

They added immunotherapy into my last couple taxol infusions and then set me up for 4 rounds of AC.  I got a scan after my 3rd AC round.  Still tumour left and then also another region glowing they werenâ€™t even looking at before.

Going into my double mastectomy I was nervous about the tumour possibly growing in my chest.  I hadnâ€™t been able to rest to fight cancer.  I hadnâ€™t been able to exercise much.  And food wise,  Iâ€™d fallen off the wagon due to my mental health sliding. After all, I was basically the only person in Covid like conditions with a boomerang germball.  It made life very limiting. AC going into gross Pacific NW weather with a now mobile baby was a living hell.

But I got to wait over Christmas which oh so fun for my pathology report.  But with the wait!  

NO RESIDUAL DISEASE and no evidence in my lymph nodes.

No I can have some time being a mom and have the mental space to think about things beyond survival.  Like what lunch box or water bottle she needs.

And soon, I can lift up my baby again. ðŸ¥°
