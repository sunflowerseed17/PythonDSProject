Going off a (often hilarious - who TF thought it would be a good idea to buy hair products for a cancer patient?!) thread where people were sharing the worst gifts they received while going through treatment. Raw food diets that cure cancer, all that nonsense. I was surprised to see fuzzy socks on a lot of comments. Maybe it's because I'm Canadian, but I live in cozy socks and those were always appreciated. What are the best gifts you've gotten/best gifts to give for someone going through this shit?? I'm not a caregiver or looking to gift anyone something I am a breast cancer patient myself; just being curious.

My faves:

- A donation to the Princess Margaret Hospital (cancer research hospital here in Toronto) with a Christmas ornament from the hospital with my name on it
- A donation to the Canadian Cancer Society in my name
- My bro bought me a Paramount Plus subscription for the year (it's a bit raunchy, but South Park at least made me laugh while I was doing AC)
- My cousin in Miami did the Run for the Cure and sent me a t-shirt that her and her friends wore while they did the run, with my name on it
- Tea. Lots of lots of tea, ginger being my favourite to help stave off the chemo nausea
- My sister in law's father is Guyanese and brought me jugs upon jugs of his famous ginger beer (non-alcoholic) that is so gingery it basically curb stomped my nausea
- I have a Cool Uncle who brought me weed edibles one time. That was fun
- Body wash and body lotions that are formulated for sensitive skin and with little to no scent
- Cute headbands and headscarves
- My Indigenous best friend made a needlepoint breast cancer symbol that I pinned to my purse for good luck
- An electric blanket for when I was always cold
- Cooling pads when I was going through the dreaded hot flashes and felt like Satan incarnate
- Food that was easy to eat; chicken noodle soup, fresh baked bread
- Handwritten cards with genuine messages in it
- A bouquet of roses

I gotta say, after being diagnosed with breast cancer, even though I lost a few friends/family members because they couldn't deal with it, mostly I had an outpouring of support. Friends from high school/university who I hadn't talked to in ages were messaging me and stopping by my house to ask me how I'm feeling. Estranged family members are no longer estranged. It really put things in perspective for me. And even though I never once asked for gifts I was always so surprised and absolutely delighted they were thinking of me. 

So, what were the best gifts you got during treatment? Maybe I'm only asking this because Christmas is on my mind.
