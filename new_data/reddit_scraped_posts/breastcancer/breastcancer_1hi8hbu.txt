I did the treatment at 11:30 this morning and then went straight to work. Didn't feel a thing, nothing different until I got home and took off my bra. My breast is now a bit sore and throbbing a bit. It's not terrible but I definitely feel it. I might put on a sports bra and see if that helps.

I can't imagine how this is going to go if I'm already feeling it. Ugh.
