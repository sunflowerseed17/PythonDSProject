I was feeling sad but resigned to ovarian suppression and have been processing that for a few weeks. I knew some things about kisquali, but not all of them. I somehow missed that it was an immunosuppressant. 
I dealt with the grief of losing my boobs, I am steeling myself to deal with whatever abrupt menopausal side effects the Lupron and letrozole bring. BUT it was an extra kick in the gut to hear that my up to now hearty immune system will also be compromised ðŸ«¤. I joke about how I'm the one in the family who never gets sick, except for cancer . Do I get to keep anything I like about my freaking body?

I am grateful these treatments are available, I have been so positive and optimistic through all of this but ugh today was a rough one.
