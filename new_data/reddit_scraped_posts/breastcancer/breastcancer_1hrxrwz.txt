(shared this in response to someone on the Zepbound sub who is concerned about food noise coming back)  
  
I've been maintaining on 7.5...injecting every 10-14 days. My weight is stable. I enjoy feeling hunger and anticipating something good to eat. I love having a craving. Even between meals. 

To me, this isn't food noise. Food noise is endless. It is never satisfied. 

I believe the longer I am on this medication, the more efficient and accurate my body is at processing what I consume so there is no "noise" other than what's supposed to be there: hunger and a desire for something specific (sometimes it's an English muffin with butter and jam, sometimes it's a protein shake, sometimes it's an apple with peanut butter, sometimes it's the oatmeal cookies with orange zest my husband made over Christmas). 

So I eat it and boom shackalacka, I am done.

Before, my body didn't process what I consumed efficiently or accurately so the noise NOISE NOISE (said in my best Grinch voice) never went away.

It took me a while to find the nuance and discernment between what it was like before Zep and what it is like now.
