As a youngish breast cancer survivor I struggle with the idea of having to wear an ugly compression sleeve daily. I also struggle with the costs and rules around them. Amazon barely has any options, medical equipment places are difficult to find and navigate . I was all set to order some cute ones on lymphdiva only to find out they don’t take FSA. Anyone else related to the struggle or have any options I’m just not aware of?
