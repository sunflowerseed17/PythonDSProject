I was diagnosed with stage one breast cancer for the second time on the other boob around Halloween. I felt it coming on in mid October. I felt the lump and I just knew what was coming. It was then that I started falling into what I guess what called a deep depression by most. I had my lumpectomy on November 26 and that sent me even deeper. I have zero desire to see friends or family. Physically I feel like someone literally knocked me out, and I am still recovering. Christmas was such a drag. I have two older kids, a teen and a 20 something who is about to move out at 1 January. I managed to keep it somewhat upbeat with them with regards to going out and doing my best to do at least one family activity/dinner per day. My ex-husband of all people stepped in to help me post surgery, which I just accepted, even though our relationship is so fraught. I’ve had therapy in the past and I don’t think it will help. I have tried meds in the past when I felt a similar depression (nothing close to this) and they just made me feel foggy. My mother pushes to come to appointments with me, etc etc and I just want to tackle this solo. I feel as if I just want to retreat into a cave until this is done and over with; I feel that nothing can help me emotionally until I am done with radiation, which starts Jan 6. I’m at a loss here. I’m thinking I just need to push through radiation and then we’ll see the light at the end for the tunnel come spring.
