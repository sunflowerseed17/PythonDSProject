I was diagnosed last week and had bariatric surgery (specifically a sleeve gastrectomy or VSG) in 2013. I'm curious what side effects from chemo may be like for those who have had bariatric surgeries.

For example,  I find it impossible to vomit, despite horrific nausea at times, ever since my surgery. It got me thinking how my sleeve surgery (or any bariatric surgery really) might impact one's experience with treatment. 

Hoping someone else who has had bariatric surgery and has already been through chemo can shed some light on this üôè
