Hi all. I was diagnosed this past August, did embryo vitrification on November and been taking Tamoxifen + monthly Leupron shots since then. My oncologist says it's possible to pause my treatment after two years so I can try to get pregnant (I'm 30yo rn and have no kids), but I could also go the five years and try to have a kid after.
I know the POSITIVE study basically says the risk stays more or less the same in any case, but sometimes I wish I can pause the treatment in two years, because I would feel safer coming back to hormone suppression after delivery, and sometimes I fear I would be putting me myself on a big risk too soon, and I should do the five years uninterrupted.

Is there any other study that could help me decide or ease my mind about whatever my decision ends up being?
Has any of you had a kid two, five or more years after diagnosis? How's been for you?
