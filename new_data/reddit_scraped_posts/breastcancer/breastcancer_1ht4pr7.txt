Prior to surgery was diagnosed with invasive lobular carcinoma stage 2 grade 2 with a 2.5cm tumor that was detected from ultrasound only ( they wouldn’t do an MRI because I was still breastfeeding at time of diagnosis). I had the lumpectomy 12/18 and I just talked to the surgeon about the pathology yesterday and it turns out the tumor was actually 6 cm. They found lymph node involvement in 2 out of the 3 nodes they took…. I’m not quite sure what stage I’m at now…. I asked the surgeon if they knew that the tumor was that big upon my initial diagnosis would
they have recommended a mastectomy? She didn’t quite give me a clear response, she told me to talk to my oncologist….but I don’t see her until 1/14. Surgeon sounded confident that she got it all out and took extra tissue beyond the margins too…. But I just don’t know what to think. I read that this type of cancer is more difficult to detect and has a higher recurrence rate and more likelihood to be in both breasts and I am nervous that they never did an MRI or anything diagnostic on my other breast…. Also the after visit summaries all say I have the “ dense breast”.
