I am helping my friend apply for Medicaid for his mom. The mom is here on a Greencard. She fell two weeks ago and was in the hospital for two weeks. She needs help moving around, going to the bathroom, basically with her ADL's. They can't afford to pay for her medical care and a caregiver out of pocket. On the application, how do they go about putting in the financial info? The form is asking for the bills and expenses for the person she lives with, but we don't want them to deny her the Medicaid if they think my friend can afford to pay for her mom. TIA
