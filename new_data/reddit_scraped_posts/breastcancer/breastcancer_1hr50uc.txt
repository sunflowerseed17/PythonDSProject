I was diagnosed with DCIS Dec 19th.  The day I was released from the hospital for a desmoid tumor on my small intestine.  My husband has been emotionally dead.  He doesn’t comfort me when I cry, he doesn’t ask if I’m ok.  I know he will not be a support system for me.  
I meet with my oncologist on Jan 8.  I have my path report but I don’t really understand all of it.  Going she can explain things.  
Just needed to vent.  I don’t feel happy for the new year.  I know I’m facing possibly the hardest year of my life.  I will lose my mother (she’s dying and on hospice) I will probably lose my husband and my boobs.
