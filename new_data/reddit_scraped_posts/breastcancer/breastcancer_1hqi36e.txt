Surgery 10th December 
Nuclear Bone scan for spinal mets 19th December

Surgeon said I’d have my histology results before Christmas ….Never happened and an appt was sent for 3rd January. Breast nurse then phoned 10 days ago to check how I was after surgery and told me she’d phone me today after the multidisciplinary meeting, with my results so I’ve been beside my phone with my notepad all day…. It’s now 16:16 (New Years Eve) and still no call…. I tried calling them and the helpline is closed due to ‘unforeseen circumstances’…. Just broken i’m going to have to wait until the 3rd. I so wanted to go into this year knowing what I am facing….
