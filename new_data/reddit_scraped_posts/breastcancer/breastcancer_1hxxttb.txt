Hi ðŸ‘‹ I have been out in LTD disability for about a year now, due to my CPTSD. It was approved for up to 2 years. I have been working hard on getting better.

Long story short, I was informed today that I have breast cancer. When the Dr told me, my reaction was one of relief, and I even made a joke. My anxiety and fears have been super low today. My SO is obviously upset. He is surprised by my non-reaction.

Does anyone have similar experience. Iâ€™m afraid, Iâ€™ve just given up. 

Editing: to say I am on disability for CPTSD, in case people are wondering a cancer post is in CPTSD
