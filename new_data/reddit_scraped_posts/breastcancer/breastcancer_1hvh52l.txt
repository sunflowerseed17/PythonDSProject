Hi Everyone,

I’m curious if anyone else has had similar results. I was diagnosed ++- stage 2 with one node positive at biopsy. I completed neoadjuvant chemotherapy and had a lumpectomy + sentinel node biopsy. The pathology report shows 4 nodes were removed altogether (2 sentinel nodes plus 2 level 1 non sentinel nodes). One of the non-sentinel nodes was the one containing my biopsy clip. Both sentinel nodes tested negative while the 2 non sentinel nodes tested positive. My surgeon said this is very rare and because of it he is recommending a ALND. I talked to my radiation oncologist who was more on the fence about the ALND,  and I’m talking to my MO tomorrow to get her take. But no one has been able to explain to me why the sentinel nodes tested negative while the other two were positive. Anyone else have similar story and if so did you receive an explanation as to how this is possible?
