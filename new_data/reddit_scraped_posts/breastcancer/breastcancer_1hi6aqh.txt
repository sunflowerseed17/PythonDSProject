Just got my first month's batch of Verzenio and the invoice that went with it knocked the wind right out of me. Thankfully my insurance is covering the full amount so I pay nothing but holy hell what they bill the insurance is *insane.* A full two year supply is going to cost my insurance about $388,000! That's the cost of a house! For what they are charging I'm surprised my pills aren't hand-delivered to me in a solid gold box with a side of caviar by a tuxedo-clad white-gloved butler.
