I want to get my husband a gift or do something for him for all he has done for me since the diagnosis. Maybe its the brain fog but I am having a hard time thinking of something… anything… i used to be so good at thoughtful gestures. I used to write love notes and make him things. But now.. idk. I want something that expresses how truly grateful I am to have him in my life. And to show how I appreciate everything he has done to be by my side during all this. 

Im literally blank on ideas or thoughts.
