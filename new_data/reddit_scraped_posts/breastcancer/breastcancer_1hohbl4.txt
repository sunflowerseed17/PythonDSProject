Long story short my husbands work has changed insurance providers taking effect 1/1/25 and because of a communication mistake I didn’t realize this until now.  I thought we were staying with the same insurance we had last year but we’re just changing our deductible plan. 

I have completed chemo but I have a mastectomy scheduled for 1/10/25.  I am terrified that this is going to delay my surgery.   

I have tried to call the new insurance but because my policy doesn’t start until after 1/1/25 I can’t get connected to a nurse navigator.   And my breast surgeon tried to submit a pre approval but again, because our policy isn’t active yet there is no way to submit it. 

Has anyone had to deal with an insurance switch mid treatment?!  Did it delay your treatment??

We had pretty good insurance and my husbands company treats their employees well so I’m hoping this new insurance company is as good as our last one.
