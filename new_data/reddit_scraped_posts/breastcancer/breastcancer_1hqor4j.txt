I was diagnosed yesterday with TNBC. My case is very frustrating with me because I found my lump back in April, got a biosy and canme back benign. In my 6 month follow up they told me the lump was growing and it was better to take it out. I did everything very fast and after my surgery the surgeon told me I did not have to worry about it. 
Results can be back as a Stage 1 grade 2 TNBC, the grow rate is low, and I have not being tested for lymph nodes yet. I have a MRI IN A WEEK. 

All I see or read is that due de aggressiveness of this type of cancer Chemo should be the first option to see how the tumor responds to it. My tumor is out, I'm spinning with the idea of they not knowing how my body will respond and I won't know if the treatment is successful. 

I'm scared, sad, angry. Btw I'm 36yo and I was ready to be a mom and now idk if I'll be able!! This is so unfair....
