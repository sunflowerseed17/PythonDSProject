I’m 45, 2.5 years post-lumpectomy. 26 months into my tamoxifen era.

I’m still having my periods, but have recently started light spotting a few days after my period ends.

My doc recommended seeing an OB-gyn to monitor things. The OB-gyn recommended a biopsy, which I was fearful of since I’ve heard it’s painful. So I instead opted for a vaginal ultrasound.

The findings showed:

3.7 x 3.6 x 3.1 cm fibroid. 

Thickened endometrium measuring 23 mm with multiple tiny cystic foci and areas of vascularity.. Endometrial thickness is 23 mm. 

RIGHT ADNEXA: 2.3 cm and 2.0 cm simple appearing cysts. 

LEFT ADNEXA: 2.0 cm simple left ovarian cyst.

They reviewed my results and said:

Your recent pelvic ultrasound results have returned thickened endometrium with some cystic areas and areas of vascularity. This vascularity could represent endometrial polyp(s). I would recommend that we proceed with a minor procedure in the OR called hysteroscopy with possible polypectomy and curettage. This would be placing a camera into the uterus (hysteroscopy) to look at the lining, remove any polyps (polypectomy) and curettage (sampling the uterine lining). 

My question is:
Should I be alarmed? 
Is thickened endometrium during tamoxifen pretty typical?
Does what the dr is suggesting seem appropriate to the situation? 
I don’t want to do too much or too little, I just want to do what I’m supposed to do.

Thanks in advance for any inputs
You all have, I obviously will take my questions to the dr too, but for those of you that have been on the tamoxifen journey and have experience in this realm, I’d appreciate your insights.
