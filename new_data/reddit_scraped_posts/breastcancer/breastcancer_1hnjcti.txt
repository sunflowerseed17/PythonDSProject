I can't help but feel guilty for being the cause of all my health issues. 

I have lots of allergies and a heart condition since I was in primary school. When I was 20, I got loads of allergies for food as well. At age 29 I got diagnosed with MS. At age 33, I got diagnosed with breast cancer.

I have no family history of MS. But on my dad's side, lots of people have had cancer of various types. Pretty much all of them besides dad. But I am negative on all genetic tests for cancer. 

I was a chain smoker for 7 years in my younger years. I've been a big drinker too in my student times and still drank too much up til my cancer diagnosis imo (similar to my peers but still too much). I never exercise. And I stress myself out too much. 

I feel like all my bad habits are or have been what lead me to my unlucky health. And I feel so guilty for failing as a human. I've talked about this in therapy too and I'm getting nowhere out of this feeling. 

How do you girls cope?

Thank you all so much for your comments and encouragement. I really appreciate reading them and I will keep reading them over and over whenever the guilty feeling creeps up again. 

Lots of love ðŸ’•
