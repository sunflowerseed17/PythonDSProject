I had an ECG on Thursday and got the results last night - Friday. I have to say I am now spiraling. It says possible anterior myocardial infarction, probably old. I’m 40. Echo cardiogram was good back in March/April before I started ACT. I’m 40. I’m freaking out. Here is the actual results: Measurements Intervals Axis  Rate: 82 P: 33 PR: 149 QRS: -11 QRSD: 82 T: 3 QT: 369  QTc: 431  Interpretive Statements Sinus rhythm with sinus arrhythmia Possible anterior myocardial infarction , probably old. 

I sent a message in MyChart to my team, I see my doctor on Tuesday. It just seems so far away. Why do results always come in when I can’t talk to anyone?!
