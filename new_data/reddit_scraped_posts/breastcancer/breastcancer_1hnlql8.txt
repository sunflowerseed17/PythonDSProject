Never made this at home before and I have no idea why! Festive, citrusy and delicious.

3 parts Prosecco 
2 parts Aperol
1 part Soda Water ( will try blood orange flavoured soda water next time) 

Actually didnâ€™t use measures - I like to free pour. 

What do you think? Any twists on the recipe you can recommend?
