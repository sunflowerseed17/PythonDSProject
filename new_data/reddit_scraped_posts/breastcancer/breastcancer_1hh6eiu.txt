I believe I have bone mets. I’m an ex nurse and for a year I’ve been having bone pain. I’ve even  thought it’s so sore I have bone mets…. Before I was diagnosed with lobular breast cancer 8 weeks ago. 
Even about a year ago I went to my GP and asked for a scan as the bone pain was sore and I didn’t meet criteria. I should have gone private then. 
Now my dexa scan ( which I paid for privately because I didn’t want the NHS wait for it) has thrown up areas of high density on spine and pelvis and so I’m booked for a nuclear bone scan.
tomorrow. 
The differential diagnoses are unlikely … Sometime you just know. I’m utterly devastated. I won’t get formal results till 3rd January - living with this uncertainty until then will be hell.
