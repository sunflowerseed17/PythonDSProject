I just leaned today that my chemotherapy drugs are killing the natural and neccessary biome in my septic tank. If you are on chemotherapy and depend on your septic system, you should call your local septic service company and have them pump it for you before you have serious issues. I wish someone had mentioned this to me earlier so I'm passing it along to anyone who needs to hear this.
