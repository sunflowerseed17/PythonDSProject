In May I’ll celebrate 10 years of being a survivor. It’s weird to think it’s been 10 years. The first 2.5 were hard and then I was able to focus on looking forward instead of looking back, for the most part.

In 2015 one of my goals was to run a race every month whether a 5k, 10k or trifecta in spartan. I didn’t get to accomplish that goal so I’m trying again here in 2025.

After active treatment cancer becomes more of a mental battle. I gained over the years 15 lbs. I was lean and fit pre cancer so looking back at photos I would go what the heck? Granted I had 4 surgeries and rads and it took years to put on.

I’m down 5 lbs and still working on the rest. Mentally a part of my subconscious said when you were your healthiest you got cancer. That was part of my mental block. If I get back to where I was, here on my 10 years what if it happens all over again. I can’t think that way but it’s something I know many of us struggle with.

I just wanted to share because I know yall understand. I’m thankful to be hitting the 10 year mark.
