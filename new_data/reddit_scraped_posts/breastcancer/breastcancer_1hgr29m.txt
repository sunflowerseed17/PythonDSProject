I have an ultrasound/mammogram in the morning to see how much my tumor has shrunk from taxol/paciltaxol and then first round of AC at 11am. I have been mildly freaking out all day. The mindfuck that is chemo. Putting a substance into your body having no clue how you will feel. But I just gotta keep counting down the days left of chemo and then my surgery. Almost thereâ€¦ almost there. 

Should I take a xanax before chemo???  I did with taxol and I was passed the heck out.
