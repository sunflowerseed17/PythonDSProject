Hi friends, I just had today’s 3rd ((of 6) TCHP chemo postponed because my blood tests showed that my white blood cell count was too low to proceed. I have been doing Granix injections after infusions but I guess it wasn’t enough - they said they’ll increase the amount of days next round. Question - what can I do to make sure my white blood cells increase by next week so we don’t have to postpone it again? Thanks in advance!
