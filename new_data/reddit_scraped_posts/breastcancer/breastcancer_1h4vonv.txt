I am triple positive. I started on Anastrozole last Friday (this morning was 4th dose) and about 8am this morning while I was doing chores I suddenly felt pain/weakness in my right lower leg. My first thought was I pulled a muscle pivoting, but over the last 45 minutes the pain feels more like a radiating pain and weakness within my right calf/leg. It hurts to walk and feels very weak. I tried “walking it out” but it was more like limping it out and it hasn’t gotten any better. I can’t go anywhere like this. I wouldn’t even be able to go to the grocery store. It’s like the leg hurts and is weak.

Is this normal on an AI? Will it go away? Someone with some experience with this please help me understand. I called my oncologists office but it could be 4pm (7ish hours from now) before they get back to me.
