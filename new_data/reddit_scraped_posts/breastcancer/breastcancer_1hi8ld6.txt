I was just diagnosed Stage 1 ER/PR +. My tumor is tiny - .4x.4x.3 and has not advanced to my lymph nodes. My lumpectomy is scheduled for the second week of January. To be overly-cautious, he’s taking a couple lymph nodes and will be performing brachytherapy at this time. He has prescribed for me 20mg of tamoxifen when I change over to a new antidepressant. (I’m currently on Wellbutrin.)

To put it bluntly, I’m terrified of tamoxifen, or rather, the side effects that go along with it. With that being said, in a post I made the other day, someone made a comment on how they were prescribed 20mg tamoxifen, but started by taking 5mg, and upping the dosage 5mg every week until she was at 20mg. I thought this was brilliant. I told both my husband and daughter about it, but I received mixed views on it. My daughter thought that would be the best way for me to start taking it- start low, go slow. However, my husband said, “That’s not how the doctor prescribed it.” 

Has anyone else taken it this way? The way I see it, if it takes me a month to get to the 20mg dose, but I continue taking it at that dosage for 5 years, it shouldn’t matter at all. Am I wrong?
