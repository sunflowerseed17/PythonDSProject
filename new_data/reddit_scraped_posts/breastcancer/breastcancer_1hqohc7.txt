48yr ++- mixed IDC/ILC. 2.8cm tumor, 1 lymph node with macromet. SMX done 12/12. Radiation is a given because of the node. They say chemo will depend on oncotype. I don't meet with my oncologist until early next week so this post is purely to see what your experience has been. 
My oncotype score is 9. I know that's low and would typically mean no real chemo benefit but I am pre-menopausal and 1 node positive. From reading other posts I can see that oncologists are split on chemo or not with these factors even when oncotype is low. I read the RXponder study that showed a modest chemo benefit for pre-menopausal women who had 1-3 nodes positive even with low oncotypes (2.4% benefit)
Any others out there near my age and stats with a low oncotype end up getting chemo? Is a 2.4% benefit a lot? I failed at statistics so I honestly don't know. Tia.
