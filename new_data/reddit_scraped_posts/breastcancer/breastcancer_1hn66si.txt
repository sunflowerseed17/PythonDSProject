Iâ€™m one week out from my DMX. Tomorrow I go see the oncologist for next steps. Of course Iâ€™m nervous about what Iâ€™ll hear and what Iâ€™ll need to do next. And alsoâ€¦.

I snuck a peak at my body and as I knew I would-it made me cry a bit. My belly right below where my breasts used to be is hard, and looks bloated. I was a 34JJJ and they removed 10 pounds of breast tissue. And it looks a bit like a slaughter jobâ€¦.i know itâ€™s just one week out and things will change. And I also know Iâ€™d do it again. But damn grrrl. This is the real stuffðŸ¤£

My chest looks concave. And Iâ€™m wondering how Iâ€™m going to find things to wear that donâ€™t just make me look like a sumo wrestler. Iâ€™m so used to having to wear big on top and tight on the bottom (I wear size 12, but I was often in yoga pants)â€¦..now what? How do I dress??

Also-alsoâ€¦..the surgeon seems to have left me with like golf ball sized flesh under my arms so that I canâ€™t comfortably put my arms down. And puckering btwn the two incisions on my breast bone. Is this normal? I am afraid Iâ€™m going to need plastic surgery just to correct the mastectomy results for quality of life! (Iâ€™m not doing reconstruction)

Love to hear from others DMX experiences!!

EDIT: also I did not poop for 4 days post surgery and for the past 3 days Iâ€™ve had just what I might say are marbles. Very little. Iâ€™ve taken colace every single day and itâ€™s just not movingâ€¦..and today I walked for quite sometime and at the end of the walk I got a sharp pain that shot through my heart making me dizzy and breathless. It happened only the one time. 

Let me know if any of this resonates with you and thx!
