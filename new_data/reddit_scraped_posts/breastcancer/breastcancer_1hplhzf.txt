I was supposed to have the single mastectomy with axillary lymph node removal tomorrow but it has been preponed tonight. I will be going into sugery in 4-5 hours. I was so not prepared for this but I am trying to stay calm.

Edit : they postponed it to tomorrow again lol. What a wild roller coaster ride.
