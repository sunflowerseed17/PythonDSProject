*Prefacing this post by saying that I feel fortunate to be concerned about side effects from medicines that lower my risk of reoccurrence. I am sending love to those metastatic thrivers out there and anyone else that may find these concerns lower on the totem pole of cancer shitiness...*

33/++- Stage 3 IDC and finished chemo at the end of October. DMX 11/22, didn't get PCR & still had positive nodes. Just finished expansions and I start 7 weeks of rads next week. 

I had my estradiol (estrogen) levels drawn at my last med oncologist appointment in December and the level was "undetectable." I have been on Lupron already for 6 months and through chemo I got menopausal symptoms (hot flashes, insomnia, vaginal dryness). 

I started Letrozole last night. I am concerned about side effects (all of them), but most specifically, weight gain. I did not gain any weight with chemo, I actually lost weight. I have had past issues with body image and gaining weight will impact my mental health so I am trying to realistically prepare myself. I am also worried about joint pain and that it will limit my mobility and decrease my ability to exercise. 

**Questions:** 

If my estradiol levels are so low before I even started the AI, am I still likely to have more side effects or am I already in it? 

How long after starting an AI did people see their side effects fully present?
