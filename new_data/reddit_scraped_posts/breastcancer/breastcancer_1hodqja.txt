I had a ct, noted mildly prominant lymph nodes mainly level 3. I have asked about it here before.  But after I asked thus I had ultra sound and a breast mri. The mri only noted level 1 nodes poossibly 2 for sure. Ultra sound shows no more than 1 node. 

What am I to trust here. I know  surgey is the final answer, but looking for those who have gone through it. 
Also mri told me my mass was 5 mm bigger than we thought, ct and ultra sound were consistent with each other on size. 

Thanks
