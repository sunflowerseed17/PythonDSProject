For me it's been more that  I shaved and it didn't grow back. I got my port a few days before starting chemo. Three months later, where I was shaved for it is still bald. I last shaved my beard three months ago too and there is nothing growing back. Hair on top of my head thinned and what s left may be lighter, though I cant tell. The top of my thighs are bald and my crotch looks like a I'm ready to do adult industry filming. My eyebrows have thinned too. Why is it though that the weird long straggle hairs between my eyebrows and on the tip of my nose are still there, still unaffected. Sigh, this is so strange.
