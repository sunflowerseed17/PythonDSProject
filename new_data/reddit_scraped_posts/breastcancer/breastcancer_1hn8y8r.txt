I (56) have been on Tamoxifen for 3 years and the random hot flashes make me nauseous and miserable. My GP just started me on Veozah this week but I was curious what others experienced on it. I know liver damage is something to keep an eye out for, so we will do follow up bloodwork after the first month.  Thanks for any info.
