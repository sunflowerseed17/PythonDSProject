I was raised catholic but have been an atheist probably since high school. I don't mind praying before a meal with religious family, it's whatever for me. 

But this year, I couldn't bring myself to do it and it left me in tears. I can't pray to a God that would have me experience cancer likely 3 times in my life (had thyroid cancer already, breast cancer now at 36, and I worry that being so young, I will have another cancer in my 60's/70's when everyone else does too).

And I think about childhood cancers, and suffering and no. I can't. I won't. Even though I am an atheist, I can't lower my head in prayer to a larger power that would do this to children, young adults, adults, anyone. I was weeping like a fool, as I thought about THANKING a God through saying grace. I am thankful to my doctors, and support groups, and my family, and my friends. I can't be thankful to a larger power who supposedly may have this all in his suspicious and secretive plan.
