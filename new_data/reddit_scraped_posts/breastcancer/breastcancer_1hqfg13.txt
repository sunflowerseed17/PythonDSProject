Hi all - 

I don't know about you, but everyone in my social circle has been sick with the seasonal flu or whatever virus is flying around.  I am post-MDX with 20+ lymph nodes removed.  Surgery was in July.  I'm doing radiation now - I have about 2 more weeks to go before that's over.  I finished chemo in October, and the doctor told me I should be good to get the flu shot after that, but I never got around to it.  My husband never got his flu shot - he missed the free clinic at his work and (ranting here) he's too lazy to do it himself.  

Well, husband came home last Thursday from work with full blown symptoms - chills, sweats, congestion.   We tried our best to quarantine but last night, I started to get chills and slight headache.  It's nothing serious, I don't even appear to have a fever as registered by my thermometer, but I'm freaking out about being sick and actively undergoing treatment.  In any other year, a seasonal virus wouldn't be so terrifying, but ever since my diagnosis I can't trust my body anymore, if you know what I mean.  Basically just looking for support.  Anyone else get hit with what's going around and make it through to the other side and can tell me that it's ok?
