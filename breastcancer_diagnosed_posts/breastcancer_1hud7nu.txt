Hi all. I’m on the keynote protocol for TNBC and have had 7 infusions of carboplatin + abraxane. Have had a reaction to keytruda so that is on hold. I had a 4 week high dose steroid taper which finished last week. I’m here asking about fatigue. I just don’t feel like this is normal. Over the last 2-3 weeks I am so exhausted showering takes all my energy. I’m winded with simple tasks. I can’t do anything but sleep and I’m usually pretty hyper. All my labs look good and I had a chest CT to rule out PE due to the shortness of breath with every little activity. Has anyone else experienced this? My infusion nurse said this is usually well tolerated but I am definitely not tolerating it well. Also have poor perfusion to my first and second fingers so just hanging out with purple painful fingers.
