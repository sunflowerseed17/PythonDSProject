Hi guys! I’m booked for my single breast mastectomy in a few days. One breast plus all the lymph nodes in that breast are going to be yeeted. I’ll then have a drain inserted that needs to be changed every day for five days. 

I was wondering what people had been told in terms of what they should avoid in terms of exercise? What was your range of movement in your arm for the first few days afterwards? What sort of exercise could you do with your arms/chest and for how long? Also what was your surgery recovery time?
