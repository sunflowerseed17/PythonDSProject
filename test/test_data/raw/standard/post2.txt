I just discovered the sub and I'm at loss. 
I see so many AI generated comment, weird egg videos and Kling content.
Is this supposed to a sarcastic sub and what are the roleplaying rules ?

Am I supposed to take low quality pictures of the sky and ask Kling to add low quality artifacts in it then ask ChatGPT to create an amateur grade article and post it on fabricated news site ?

Are you those guys going to cheer on me too or do I have to create multiple AI driven accounts?
