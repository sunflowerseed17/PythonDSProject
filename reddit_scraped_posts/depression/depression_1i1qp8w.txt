One of the things that irks me so much about depression is that I know I have so much in life, but it doesn't seem to make me happy.  I have buckets and buckets to be grateful for, none of which I want to lose. And yet, I just go around in my head and think that my life is a failure, that I really don't know why I am alive or why I don't feel joy or satisfaction or pleasure. I don't know what I should want or what my goals should be. I contemplate different changes, but don't see the point and also feel limited in my own abilities and circumstances. I feel disconnected and alienated. I am legit in the most beautiful place in the world fulfilling a life dream since childhood... and I'm still depressed.
