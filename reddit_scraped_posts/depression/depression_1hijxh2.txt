Every morning I wake up in a panic. Crying, confused, disoriented. My sleep is a constantly interrupted mess of exhaustion and fear. Dreams are unbearable. Therapy, outpatient, medication, helplines, none of it is easing this burden. I’m so scared. The few friends and family I have left are terrified for me. I can’t live with this guilt and regret. This blackness is consuming every fiber of my being. It feels like trying to scoop food dye out of water. It’s as much a part of me as the air in my lungs and blood in my veins. Simple tasks like hygiene and cleaning feel impossible. I am slowly decaying into nothingness.
