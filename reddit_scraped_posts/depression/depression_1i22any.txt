Depression hit me square in the jaw a few months ago and I've slowly been crawling out of the depressive slump after a failed attempt and now I'm dealing with societal expectations to be doing better than I am right now.   

I've been unemployed for almost 2 years now, late diagnosed with t1d last year and have been digging for every bit of will power I have just to pretend like I want to be here when in reality I was 60 seconds away from succeeding when they found me lying on the floor and took emergency action.   I did not fail to administer my attempt, they got lucky and decided to open my door, something they never do.  

So here I am right now, pretending that I'm grateful, faking my way through college classes while applying for jobs,  trying to convince myself that I still want to be here.   

So fake it till you make it guys.   One day it might feel real but today just do what you can.
