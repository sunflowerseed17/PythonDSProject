Ive tried every method to be normal.
Self help books, therapy, medication, smoking alcohol you name it. 
I eventually found refuge in numbing my life in anime, manga, porn, work and food. It worked for a couple years but ive relapsed last year and i dont know what wrong anymore i dont feel like doing anything, ive distanced myself from family and friends again and im underperforming at work. 
I just dont know what to do anymore i cannot feel joy. I feel like kms the thoughts are growing stronger and stronger. 
I just feel so empty so alone ...
