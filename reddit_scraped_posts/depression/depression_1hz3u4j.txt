I just rewatched The Lion King (1994), and well, it just doesn’t sit well. I know that Mufasa and TLK 2019 are part of the same universe and not 1994, yada yada, but ultimately, we have a 2019 version and by extension the Mufasa movie BECAUSE of the 1994 thing.

The biggest issue for me is that during the time of TLK 1994, monarchy seems pretty much solid and established in the Pride Lands/Milele. There seems to be a strong running tradition of kingship, particularly based on birth. Mufasa comes of as a commanding king. His dealings with Scar are a little high handed in the film to be honest. Scar for his part is suave, but just plain wicked. I know time has passed since the end of Mufasa and the beginning of TLK but idk, it seems to big of a difference in their characters.

But the MAJOR plot hole is that the entire candidature of Simba for the throne and his place as the One True King is BECAUSE he is Mufasa’s son. And Mufasa is the one who seems to emphasise this birth based monarchy repeatedly. If we were to look at TRAITS, let’s be honest, the way things were Simba wasn’t equipped enough to be king. He was Hakuna Matata-ing his way through adulthood. I don’t blame him, but he isn’t really king material. Mufasa’s spirit knows it too, but he insists Simba take his RIGHTFUL place in the Pride Lands because “you are my son, and the one true king”. 

It really doesn’t align with the way Mufasa was chosen as king. And it’s like that for Mufasa, democracy existed only till he was elected, after which it’s thrown out of the window? It really doesn’t make any sense. It’s as if they didn’t even watch the original before making Mufasa.
