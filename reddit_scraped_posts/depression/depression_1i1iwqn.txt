I have no energy at all, I wake up and I am immediately tired, I am tired all day and I have no energy to do anything even though I know I have to do it.

It does not matter how much I sleep. At the weekend I sleep up to 12 hours, during the week I sleep 3-5 hours.

I want to have the energy and motivation to study at school, go out with friends, learn new things, exercise, but I cant. Its so frustrating and I dont know what to do against it.
