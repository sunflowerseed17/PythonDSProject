I'm 19, male, and I have a vision for my future. When I grow up and become financially stable, I want to have at least one, max is 2, biological children and adopt a third—though the order doesn’t matter. I’m an atheist and also interested in entrepreneurship.

In the past, I believed that if my goal of building a successful business and giving back to those in need didn’t succeed, I would adopt a child and raise them with my partner, hoping that God would bless us in return.

However, as I’ve grown, my perspective has shifted. Now, I feel strongly that adoption is about compassion, not about seeking blessings or fulfilling some kind of personal reward. I truly want to adopt a child, regardless of my entrepreneurial success. It’s about giving a child a loving home and making a meaningful impact in their life.

I’m curious to hear others’ thoughts—does my perspective on adoption make sense, even though it’s no longer tied to my financial goals or religious beliefs?
