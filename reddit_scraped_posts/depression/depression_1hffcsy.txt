I have acne, mild acne scars and uneven skin tone issues. I want to get married by next year and I want to reduce the acne and everything. I am okay with getting treatments but first of all it’s very expensive in the places I went and second is that it’s difficult to trust those doctors and they start suggesting treatments even without any tests or asking any questions. 
I currently stay in Hyderabad. Can anyone please give me contact of genuine and affordable dermatologist or clinic? Preferably around Masab Tank area. But I am open to other places also. 
Also, if someone has experience in these treatments, please tell me how to know if a clinic is actually genuine.
