So, for quite sometime I've been having marriage problems. This year it has all finally come to a tipping point. My husband and I have been friends with my best friend for the past 15 years at least. We've grown into a makeshift family. We don't have kids but they do. The kids basically call us aunt and uncle and my husband adores them very much. Lately, I finally divulged much information that I have kept to myself. Different marital issues. My unhappiness. How he's treated me...just things that have happened over the years. Now, we used to do more family oriented stuff,  meeting up at places for holiday stuff and just hanging out together. This year, we really haven't done any of that stuff despite talking about it. I'm in this marriage for now, maybe forever, maybe not. Despite his treatment, I still find myself feeling bad for him. I had this huge fear of telling people all of the truth because I didn't want him to lose these connections. I know they're allowed to make that decision for themselves about how they feel about his behavior.  But I think he feels it too, which in turn makes him very sad and causes him to sulk. Which I then have to still kind of form to. Like I still care for him and the fact that he feels sad and it makes me feel like the bad guy.  I also feel worse if I go do the thing without him, knowing that he feels upset about it. My feelings are all twisted up about it. I don't want to have distance between my own best friend and myself, but I also am not capable of leaving this marriage at this point in time. What do I do? How do I sit with these feelings of anxiety, missing opportunities for connection, sadness? How on Earth do I moderate this?
