Just bought the Monster hunter humble bundle pack because I want to get into the series before Wilds so I started with Worlds and it feels overwhelming. I start the game and there are so many things to upgrade and stats to look for and I just have no idea what I'm doing. What stats should I look for and what are some tips for beginners like myself that have no other entry in the series?
