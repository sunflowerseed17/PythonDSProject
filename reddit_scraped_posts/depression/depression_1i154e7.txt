Hello, I'm a 23 years old man. I used to struggle a lot with mental illness during high school (Derealization), feeling like I would never recover but I finally did. I then lived the best years of my life during college and seriously thought that I had conquered my mental issues.

Now my studies comes to an end and my mental health slowly decreased since May 2024. I am pretty successful in school, I have a family that loves me but today I feel like life is not worth living anymore, I don't feel any joy, I'm feeling stuck because I don't want to kill myself for my family that loves me, however I'm certain I will never make it. I never felt so bad in my entire life, the derealization episode I had during high school was hard but at least I didn't want to die. I'm still functionning, going to college, etc... But what's the point of all of this ?  I'm followed by a psychiatrist who prescribed me Zoloft, but it really feels like it is making things worst. I will probably ask to change meds but my next appointement is in next week and feels like an eternity. The moment of joy I had in my life feels like a lie, sadness and emptiness feels like the thruth, it feels like it's what real life is.

I'm writing this because I want to hear some success stories of people who felt the same way, I really need some reassurance right now.
Thanks you for reading.
