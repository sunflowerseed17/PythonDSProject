(Tried posting this on the ufo subreddit but it kept getting locked immediately for some reason)

More specifically “UFO: the inside story of the US government’s search for alien life here-and out there”. Yeah. A mouthful. It’s semi recent, I believe it came out in 2023. I figured a large part of this sub would have read it 

I’m about 1/4th through myself. 25% done. It’s good! Solid. Perhaps maybe a little dry but I understand the author is trying to bring a legitimacy and authenticity to things. Sometimes I am goin “cmon man you could pump this up a little bit here” as he describes some pretty paranormal extraordinary ufo encounters the same way I’d describe my last Walmart grocery run. 

That said I do still maintain that I’m enjoying it, and I appreciate him staying grounded and realistic. There’s some chapters ahead that I can’t wait to see the lowdown on. Men in black, tic tac incident, abductions, Phoenix lights etc

Was wondering this subs thoughts on the book!
