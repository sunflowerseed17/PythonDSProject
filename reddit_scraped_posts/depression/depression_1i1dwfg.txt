First time writing here; sorry for mistakes.  
I’m not really sure how to start this.  
I’m currently in college, but I feel out of place and like I don’t belong there. I'm not even sure if I like my major. I’m struggling to keep up with the workload, and it’s draining me mentally and emotionally.  

I’ve been thinking about dropping out because it doesn’t feel right for me anymore. I was considering getting a job and applying to a different college this summer.  
But what will people say—that I’m a dropout, good for nothing?  
I feel like Im failing again. Will i ever f do something right
It’s not just this; I’ve been depressed for a long time, and I have no support. I’m always there for people, but no one is here for me, and this time it’s bad.
Why can't they see how bad it is when a random old grandma on the bus, who doesn't know me, can see?
I started using pills; I know it’s a stupid thing, but I just want my mind to shut up for a minute.  
I genuinely feel like there's something wrong with me, my brain.  

What do I do?
