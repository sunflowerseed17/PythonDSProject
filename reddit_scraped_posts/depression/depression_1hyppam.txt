 To call this film a cycle of unrelenting cruelty is a gross understatement. The drama mostly centers around the dregs of society. People that are rarely capable of showing any sort of kindness. They crawl around in the filthy slums, kicking and punching each other for money, sex, or drugs. The few that actually aim for something more substantial such as love end up being broken spiritually. As a gay man, I was particularly horrified by the physical and mental abuse a queer man suffered. I haven't seen something so depressing in a long time. Yet on the other hand, the movie is riveting. Why? Because it intelligently summarizes that we will never get anywhere unless we all sincerely reach for something beyond material possessions. So, great film but it will be awhile before I watch it again!
