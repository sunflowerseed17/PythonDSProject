I'm in need of an upgrade, and I thought a p330 is nice because of the power it has for such a small size. It's got an i5-9500T, and a nvidia quadro P620. Now I dont need the most powerful pc in the world. I mostly just play lightweight games like team fortress 2, CS 2, roblox, and other esports titles. And I also do the occasional tinkering with blender from time to time, not in depth tho, just basic stuff. 

And really I'm just buying it for the form factor, so I dont mind if price to performance isnt the best, just enough to run my stuff smoothly.


My school used to have this as school PCs and they were suprisingly very powerful, but that was a couple years ago back in 2020 so I'm not sure how well they hold up now. Is it still a good buy for 2024?
