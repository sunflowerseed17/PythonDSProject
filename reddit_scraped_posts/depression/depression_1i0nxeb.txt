Today in the morning a family member called me and my mom that they found our family friend fainted on the ground so I went straight away with my mom shortly after when I came in the room the person who called us was panicking and stressed he wanted to use alcohol to wake up but as soon as I saw that his face was blue and his lips and hands I called 911 they told me to check breathing and pulse but I shocked to and couldn't really tell I just told 911 thier was a faint harte beat and breathing but like I said I was not sure to be honest so then I was told to stat cpr so I did for about 10-15 minutes until paramedics got here but to be honest I wasn't doing much it was my first time in a situation like this i doubt I was even putting enough force and rhythm I was trying but in that stressful situation it was hard to give it all I had so it's hard because   i would have done it right I could've bought the paramedics some time until they got here so it's hard to not blame my self
