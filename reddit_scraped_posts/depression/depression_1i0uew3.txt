I am a 15 years old teenager with diagnosed Asperger since 6, and I always hated that I was. Recently, I couldn't agree even more. I am at a state where socials contacts are very important to make, and since I, like I said, have Asperger, I have a hard time trying to talk to people. I don't know what to said at what time to which people with which attitude, and that's without talking about the slutters that I get every 10th sentence. In the sport program that im in, there are 2-3 people who are constantly destroying my self-esteem whenever i find the courage to trynna be social, and since they are most of the time hanging out with my only friends, I still find myself most of the time alone, and it crushed me to the point where mentally, I reached rock bottom. I feel that my friends have gotten the same mentality as these 2-3 guys I mentioned earlier these times. I also feel that my friends are sometimes rejecting me and instead are going with these guys. My coach doesn't seem to be able to make em walk straight so ig they'll still do this until I quit the program. These guys also have adhc so they take a lot of place and for some reason, my friends are loving that attitude of theirs. I don't wanna leave the program, but at the same time, I don't my self-esteem to get somehow lower to the point of ending it all. It's sad that I have these thoughts without the struggle of living as an adult. Has an asperger here ever went throught this, and if yes, do you have any tip for being more social and loving yourself and tolering people who are missing you off, because really can't take it anymore. Thanks.
