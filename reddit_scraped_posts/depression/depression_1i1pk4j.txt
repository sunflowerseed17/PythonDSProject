Sometimes I feel like I could wear ski masks the whole year in classes every day. I feel like my family issues and background have an impact on this. As a child, I remember during family functions, my cousins would ignore me. They would hang out together and just exclude me. That's one of the main reasons I no longer visit family gatherings. I've been living with my grandparents ever since I was born, and even today, theyâ€™re the ones I live with. My parents never bonded with me and my siblings, and they separated when I was in 2nd or 3rd grade. Because of this, I sometimes feel unwelcome in public spaces.

I also feel like a burden, which is why I focus on improving myself and getting financially stable as soon as possible. I want to start my own life and live independently, away from the weight of these issues. I know that financial stability and independence are key to starting fresh, but sometimes the emotional baggage makes it hard to push forward.
