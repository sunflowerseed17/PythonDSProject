So I hit a curb that had a dent in it and it was a bad impact. Like really bad. Curiously, the car drove fine last night save for that it felt like maybe something under it got damaged as it groaned and creeked a little more. But otherwise fine. This morning though the orange swerve/steering light (like the one that comes on if you slide in ride or snow) and the red “BRAKE!” Light are on sometimes on and off but mostly always on even though the car is ostensibly driving just fine. Any ideas? Firestone looked under it and told me they couldn’t see anything dislodged or damaged  but did say my “rear breaks” or something like that were messed up and recommend a fix
