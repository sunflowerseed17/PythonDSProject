My father and mother have never been the perfect couple. As far back as I can remember, they've always fought. But recently, my father has been unbearable. Seriously. My mother barely talks to him except about trivial everyday things. He doesn't work because he retired early, so he spends all day sitting on the couch sucking up to politicians on the internet. He physically attacked my mother once, and as I grew up I was very afraid of him (I mentioned that in another post). I didn't do anything. He ended up in jail for a while, but my mother soon went back to him. For a while, everything was fine, but now it's back to normal. He hasn't attacked her again, but he makes comments with the intention of irritating her or ironically, like "are you scared of me?" or "how mean you are". I currently work and go to college, so I'm barely home. I feel that since she and I both work, we could manage on our own in a small house/apartment, but we have dogs and a cat, which would make it difficult to find a place to live.  But I can't stand hearing their comments and hearing her sighing in anger/frustration anymore, I really wouldn't care if he died...

Any tips on how to convince her to separate? Obviously I'll tell her this in secret and if possible talk to her brothers about it...
