I am an extremely envious person. But after so many years with depression, bd, eating disorders and so on, I feel that it is starting to get out of control.
It makes me really mad to see pretty girls, confident, in happy relationships. 
I feel like it literally erodes me inside, and sometimes I even want to hurt myself thinking "Why cant i be like her"...
