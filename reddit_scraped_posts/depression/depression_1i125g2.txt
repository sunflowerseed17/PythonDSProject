I just turned 40 the day before and I haven’t been successful finding anyone for about a decade now. I always wonder what’s wrong with me, do I look so ugly? I understand gays are after muscles and all , but I don’t really go to the gym for aesthetics, but I mainly go to powerlift! I have certain goals for that. I have been pretty depressed with this and can’t see a way forward!
