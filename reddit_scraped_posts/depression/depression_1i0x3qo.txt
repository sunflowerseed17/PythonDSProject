Im 17 , Last week I attempted for the first time and I think its time to admit Im lost , I always told myself I would never attempt / take my own life however , I wasnt thinking right that night. It always held me back knowing I would put that pain onto my mother. And it would kill me for her to know the pain ive been feeling lately. I would hate for her to feel guilt for not knowing when how could she have? I feel like nobody understands who I really am. People only see the fun happy side of me and I feel no one would care to know the depressed fucked up side about me. Last summer I got cheated on by the one person who I ever felt got me , My girlfriend of 3 years. I was so heartbroken and I had no one to turn to. I never hated myself so much.  I changed every single thing about myself until I was unrecognizable because I hated seeing myself in the mirror , Im sorry if my post sounds like a bunch of jumble I just have never been able to get any of this off my chest. It feels like im only getting worse with no one to vent to. Also feels as if "help" would only make things worse. I dont know what to do , I really need advice right now. To anyone who would be willing to give me their time , please and thank you
