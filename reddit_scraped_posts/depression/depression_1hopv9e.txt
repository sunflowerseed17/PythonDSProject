Idk what it is, maybe it was the whole Christmas season or something but I know for sure that I don’t have seasonal depression specifically. It’s just been really bad lately. Few months ago I was diagnosed with 2 types of depression, major depressive disorder and persistent depression which is depression that lasts for 2+ years. I feel like I will never get better and I feel like crying but I can’t cry, I can’t get the tears out anymore. I feel very hopeless and alone and have also been >!very suicidal lately, like every day kind of suicidal!<
