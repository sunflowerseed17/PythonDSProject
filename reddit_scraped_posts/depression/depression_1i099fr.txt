I was in an accident when I was a kid falling off the roof and hitting my head causing severe bruising and  a huge bump. i have always had trouble learning, socializing, emotional issues, etc. 

however my skull is currently changing abnormally, and I think it’s causing damage to my brain. My frontal bone is receding and occiput is growing upwards, but because I never took pictures and have 3d reconstruction scan of my skull growing up now no one believes me and I am so fucked. I am living in a nightmare. I am at home suffering  because I am constantly having these symptoms  dizzy, double vision, extreme forgetfulness, off balance, brain inflammation, and other neurological symptoms. It’s so fucked beyond belief. i think my brain never grow properly also which is why I have had issues growing up. I am lost and don’t know what to do, i dont know how to prove my story to any doctor without them thinking I’m crazy. My mri scan came out normal however my skull is changing gradually. I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO. I feel intellectually disabled, even writing this is difficult and hurts my brain.
