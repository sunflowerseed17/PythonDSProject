I've hit the wall, there isn't any going back for me. I've been mob bullied at work for years, I look absolutely horrendous I have zero sex life, social life, and on top of it all I have a diagnosis of an autoimmune disease called BXO Litchen Sclerosus that had destroyed my penis permanently, and the future is going to be full of surgery's and looking for cancerous changed every day. I cant have sex like this, what's life without love and relationships? It's not worth it. I will never bring a soul to this place. Wish I was never born, and I'd love to get hit by a car unexpectedly. My whole life I've been seen as less than because I never fit it, I have so many issues I cant even look at people directly. Everyone I've ever known ends up hating me or backstabbing me. My mum shows so much affection and pride in my other brothers and there's me. Nothing passed small talk how was your day ect. Death is a gift.
