Hey there, I’m not sure how to word this really but in the past I was treated really horribly, over time I got over it. But now I feel like I’m soaked in pain, if that makes any sense? I look for people who could take care of me usually, I want to be wanted, I want to matter. And being a female only makes it harder as obviously guys will be guys, and I don’t want that all the time, it hurts me. Anyways I’m not sure where I was going with this but, it’s hard not having anyone to keep me going. :(

I also barely use my Reddit anymore so add my snap as I will see messages better on there as I can get overwhelming and it’s: epearsonoxox 

If you read this, Thankyou.
