i wish i was dead. i’m tired of trying and being told it will get better but it rlly doesn’t. everyday is another day to pretend to be ok so you don’t get yelled at by people telling you to be grateful and that a starving child in africa wishes they could be you. i feel like i’m being forced to live a life that i don’t want to. there’s no peace in life and no peace in death either. there’s no way out. i’m just a random meaningless dot on the earth
