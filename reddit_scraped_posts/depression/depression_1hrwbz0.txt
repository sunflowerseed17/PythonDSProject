I'm nauseous but at the same time hungry. (A little TMI but like low-key either constipated or like having soft almost diarrhea...) My heads been pounding for days. When I move around it feels weird...like my body moves but I don't move with it? And every morning I feel like I'm hung over (never been hung over in my life but it's what I imagine being hung over feels like) and I'm exhausted...

I have been seeing a rheumatologist to try and find out what is wrong with me physically. I get migraines constantly, this weird sort of head pounding, lagging out of my body thing has happened before, but I was wondering if anyone has any advice? I hate feeling like this and just want something to relieve the way I feel. I've tried chugging water, dark room, sleeping, medical marijuana, no medical marijuana...it just won't go away...

Edit: I also feel like I should add the only thing that helps with the sort of lagging feeling is laying flat on my back. I also am on 60mg Duloxetine for Fibromyalgia and I've been on that since September. (Also after talking with my family this has been happening since SundayðŸ˜… sorry for the confusion...)
