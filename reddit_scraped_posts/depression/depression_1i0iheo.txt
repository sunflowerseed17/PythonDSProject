Hey Reddit fam… I know I know…you all are 
doing well and even if you aren’t don’t back down remember we are warriors, we can’t back down… no one ever said these things to me… maybe if even one soul did.. I won’t have been like who I am right now, and would have been confident as ever .. fighting this internal battle isn’t easy for me… in this world full of demons..  I’m a lingering soul who doesn’t know what to do and who to be… the least I can do.. is to still hope, EVERYTHING WILL SOON END, MY LIFE WILL GET BETTER… and I will never stop hoping , because I know ‘humans are the worst creatures to exist’, and we aren’t a blessing , but a curse.. life is not candy.. but poison.. fate can change tables.. which kills the willing ..and drags the unwilling.
