A few months ago i made a post where I talked about how I felt hopeless. Back then I was uneployed and I thogght that was the main reason why I was feeling so depressesd. Anyway, back in october I finally a job and altought it made me happy it also made me feel even shittier. The job in question is a entry job, administrative assistant and I'm 28y. That's when I realised I failed in life. The job in question is very slow, last week I've had barely any work to do and today they asked me go work in the factory helping to organize the new building. Of course I didn't go there (I don't want to do something completely different of what we agreed on paper, and the factory is far away from the office) instead I came home... Now I feel awful, I feel like I may lose this job, feel like a failure again, feel like there is no point in existing anymore. Living in society was always so difficult to me, idk idk what to write anymore or how to discribe what I'm feeling.. I just wanna stay inside all day or just disapear or maybe be forggoten by everyone
