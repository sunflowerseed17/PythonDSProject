Is it just me having issues on this week in between Christmas and NYE? I’m actually panicking because I fear something is wrong with my app or it’s just me

Thursday and Friday, today, are dead as fuck. The deadest I’ve ever seen it (I’ve only been doing uber since February of this year).

Is this the norm? Cause I see tons of people out and the heat map says it busy but I’m sitting in my car for 20-30 minutes at a time and not a single request for yesterday and today
