I had one last thing i loved but even it is taken away from me. I can't fucking see the point of living if i'm fucking created to suffer. I just kept continuing to get better but now it feels like living a healthy, happy life for me isn't possible anymore. I deserve rewards too. I didn't deserve all of this. I'm so fucking done. I have almost nothing that makes me stand out or makes me proud anymore. It's like i am only born to appreciate others getting rewards. I use to believe in working would give me results and it fucking did but now i see others getting all of them without even trying. Why is life so fucking unjust?
