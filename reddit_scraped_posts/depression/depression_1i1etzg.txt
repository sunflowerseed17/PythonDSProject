I am 32F who currently stays with my mom and my 4 kids-7, 4, 2, and 2. I moved back in with her bc my depression was so bad it was debilitating. My kids go to daycare and school during the week and you would think I would have energy and want to get things done but NOOOOO. All I do is lay in bed all day on my phone and every once in a while I will sleep but not always. I lay in the room in the dark and just donâ€™t want to do anything. I usually get up around 2:30 and do little things that need to be done and then lay back down until I go get my kids and then I take care of them until bed and just forget about myself. Does it get better? I just started Lexapro 10mg but the lack of energy is destroying me. I just want to be happy again ðŸ¥º can anyone relate?
