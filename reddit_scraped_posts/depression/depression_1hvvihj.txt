Something I never understand is why some people play JRPGs as their genre of choice. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty that I enjoy myself but I feel like the genre is so specific. Why does the region the game was developed in such an important factor people? Is it the anime style? Why do some people enjoy it more than western RPGs like the witcher?
