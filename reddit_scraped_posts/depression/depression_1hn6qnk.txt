I'm currently 31 weeks pregnant and I wanted to know what options I have in regard to pregnancy benefits. I know New Jersey offers Temporary Disability Insurance and Family Leave Insurance. 

However, I lost my job in early October (I hadn't even told my job I was pregnant yet). I'm currently collecting unemployment. I haven't looked for a job because I wanted to focus on my pregnancy. What options do I have for pregnancy benefits? Can I get anything in addition to my unemployment benefits?
