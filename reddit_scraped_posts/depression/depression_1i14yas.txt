Hello everyone, I'm here to share my story as a story of hope, of how I overcame (and am overcoming) depression.
Over a year ago now, I got the job of my dreams as a tech team lead in Japan, but when I went there it turned out to be a nightmare- mad long 12 hour days, ridiculous expectations, and plus the difficulty of managing a relationship with my then partner long distance to Bangkok. It turned south pretty quick, and in the span of 3 months I became heavily insomniac, anxious and depressed and thought the only way out was off my balcony in Japan. It was a dark time. But happily I had a manager and team who helped me move back - messily - to Bangkok with steadfast family to support me. I was on like 7 different kinds of antidepressants, in significant debt to my company, and it seemed over many times over. But a year + later I'm happy to say that I built a path forward as a platform operator in SaaS, an admissions coach and (recreationally) swimming, dancing and working out often to beat away the dark clouds. The two jobs keep me decently busy but not suicidally overworked, and I've learned that I'm not my thoughts, I can work productively to be engaged, mindful and happy each day, still travel frequently, and hey - I think I am still making more money than I ever have in my life. I'm still struggling with addiction to some degree, I still have brain fog (maybe from the meds) and there are things I regret, but it's the best we can do each day to keep being content and moving onward. Treasure this life - it is the only one you have! And with consistent effort and focusing on small but certain happiness, it can be quite beautiful! Have faith my friends!!
