I left social media (insta and fb) coz fomo was causing me a lot of anxiety. But even now I have fomo anxiety and I get very sad because of it. My bf’s friend invited me to his big wedding which I won’t be able to attend because I had already booked my tickets to go home. I tried a lot to rebook the tickets but it is very expensive and I won’t be able to spend much time at home then. My home is far. Now I am having fomo that I won’t be able to attend the wedding and I know it will be fun. I don’t know if spending that much will be worth it. I know if I tell about my anxiety to my bf and ask for his advice, he will find it weird. I need someone to help me make a decision sometimes. But I also feel that I should not depend on people for these things. I just feel angry and anxious. What do you people do in these kinds of situations?
