I am 33 and have suffered from really bad depression for the last 23 years. I have gone from believing I would never kill myself to gradually believing it’s inevitable for me. For the last roughly 6 months, I have felt like the edge has gotten within eyesight. The smallest stupidest things bother me so much more than they should, but it’s because I am so close to the edge and an inch closer means a lot when you’re a few feet away. I am so miserable every day and my self esteem, if I even have any left, gets lower and lower. I have isolated myself from society and lack the social skills to successfully enter it. I have zero friends in and outside of work, live alone, don’t have any pets. I have a job, but if I disappeared it wouldn’t matter. Over the years, my ‘reasons not to kill myself list’ has gotten shorter and shorter to where it’s pretty much only not wanting to hurt my Mom. Honestly if she died now I would kill myself within 24 hours. If I had what I would use, it would be within 24 minutes. I feel like the biggest failure for letting my life go this way. I always wanted to get married, be a Dad, and raise a family of my own. I thought things would just kind of fall into place, but I’m 33 with nothing to show for it. I’m overwhelmed that I missed my opportunity to have the only thing I ever wanted. One might say 33 is still young, which I would agree for a socially normal 33 year old, but I’m not. I’m 33 but socially I feel like I’m still a friendless introverted teenager. I am so mad at myself and feel so stupid and embarrassed.
