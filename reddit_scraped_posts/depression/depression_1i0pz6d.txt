I’m going through a lot. I don’t know what’s happening, but I feel both optimistic and pessimistic at the same time.

It all started after my 22nd birthday. I thought I was the happiest person alive, but I had no idea what life had in store for me.

I have strong opinions, but I feel both strong and weak at different moments. After all, I’m just human.
Things might work out for me—or they might not.

I’m in a constant dilemma.
I’ve always wanted to help people going through what I’m experiencing right now.
There’s so much I want to share and say, but I don’t feel like the same person I was three years ago.

I wonder about the afterlife, but I love my parents and relatives. Still, I can’t bring myself to share my problems with them.

I’m constantly fighting with myself.

I just want to help people in need and make this society more livable. But sometimes, even for me, it feels unbearably hard—and even hard to breathe.

To all the people who are suffering i wish to be better so i can help you all.
