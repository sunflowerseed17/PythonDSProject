I already had HSV 1 ages ago ( which is very common), however I had receptive oral sex with a guy somewhere around Christmas. I have had flu like symptoms since then on and off and by 30th of December or so, I was perfectly fine. Now, since 2nd of Jan or so, the flu like symptoms came back and since a week I see red painful blisters around my anus, a little itchy penis, and very tender and lumpy groin. I am extremely fatigued with joint pains and muscle ache. I had to go to urgent care today as I was scared. The doctor examined my hole and said it’s herpes outbreak. Wrote a bunch of tests and pie me on antiviral. 

My question is that I haven’t had any receptive anal sex, haven’t even let any guy rim ny hole as well. Can oral sex lead to genital herpes? Also, is it always hsv2 if it shows up on genitals? Now, even if it suppresses and goes away, will I be able to have sex and not pass HSV2 even when I am healthy? I’m flipping out, can you please help?
