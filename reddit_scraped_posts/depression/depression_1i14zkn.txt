I'll get to the point, life hasn't been kind. I tried everything be as positive as possible with encountering problems. Been in therapy and I am currently medicating. The daily meds hasn't been enough, I still have the lingering sensation of wanting to die. Left my good paying job because it burned me out and since quitting I feel useless. On a daily basis my mom would berate me that I am a useless couch potato, although behind close doors I have received tons of rejections from companies. I just want to end it all, its as easy as slitting my wrist. I have been in a dark place and I don't see a way out. I am trying my best but its all in vain. I just want to die and rest and run away from everything I am tired.
