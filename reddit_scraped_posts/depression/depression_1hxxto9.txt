I wish my parents ended up with a different child deserving of everything they’ve given me. I wish I was a good person. I’m so tired of trying but I don’t want my family to hurt so I force myself to keep existing. SSRIs, weekly therapy, daily exercise, going to work, hanging out with friends, trying to engage in hobbies that used to bring me joy. Nothing helps. I don’t know what to do anymore
