i understand the rooms being a point of contention but i’m sorry this was so weird 😭 whyyy did he just start handing random people hundred dollar bills? like luke got $200 for switching rooms and “being a good sport” and then just like hands amanda $200 like it’s nothing. is he worth that much? is pillow money like that? i don’t remember him doing that last season ..? if i were any of them i’d be seriously side eyeing him after this and just assume he’s going to try to make me his personal butler waving money at me
