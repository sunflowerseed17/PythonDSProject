I'm so tired. Every day feels like an uphill battle from the moment my alarm goes off in the morning to the second I manage to fall asleep at night. And throughout all of it, I'm always the person people come to when they need advice.

Feeling like people don't love you? Come rant to me about it so I can reassure you repeatedly. Need a shoulder to cry on? I have two of them. Been so depressed you haven't cleaned in a week and haven't made dinner? I'll come over to help you clean and make you dinner.

And throughout all of it, I'm still struggling, never able to tell people how bad it's getting inside my own head. I've been good at pretending since I was a kid. Sometimes I wonder if I even know how to open up like that to others, if I know how to admit that I feel the pain, too.
