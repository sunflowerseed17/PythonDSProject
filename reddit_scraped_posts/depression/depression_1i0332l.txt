I've suffered from depression since I was 13. I was formally diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder in my mid 20s. My depression has been exacerbated so much during my pregnancy. 

I lost my job when I was 20+1 and I feel so useless. I feel like a burden because I'm useless financially. I feel like a burden because I need so much help. I feel alone AND lonely. I feel like people don't care about me. I've honestly felt hopeless and suicidal a few times, a feeling I haven't felt since a few years ago during the pandemic. 

I just want to be happy during my pregnancy, especially since I'm at the latter end... A little over one month to go until I get to the finish line. But I just feel depressed and miserable and alone all of the time. I'm always crying and I hate that my baby boy can feel everything I'm going through. I'm so sorry that he has to struggle with my mental health too. He's the only thing keeping me alive honestly. I don't know what I'd do if I lost him. 

I hope my son never has to experience depression like I have/like I do. I hope he never feels lonely in a room of family. I hope his mental health will be better than mine. I hope heâ€™ll always feel loved and included.
