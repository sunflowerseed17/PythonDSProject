for a couple years now since the age of like 13 i remember depressive episodes. they would be very intense (super close to committing to yk) but be no longer than 2 weeks. this would happen once or twice a year. if anything was longer it wouldnt be as intense. 

and im not sure about mania/hypomania, but again, nothing would be consistent for months. 

but like i JUST had a super intense depressive episode that lasted a week and a half and now im like “well that was quite dramatic, i feel completely normal now” and it almost feels like that never even happened. but it VERY much did. 

are cycles like this common in bipolar? if not, any ideas what could cause very intense but short depressive episodes 😅?

my sister has been diagnosed and my mom is currently questioning it with her psychiatrist.
