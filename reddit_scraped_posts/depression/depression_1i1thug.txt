Does anyone have any tips on how to instantly cure suicidal ideation and existential dread😌😂🙏

IM CRASHING OUTTTTT is anyone else crashing out؟؟؟؟؟؟ my Vyvanse and Zoloft are working overtime rn feeling suicidal and anxious cause I just started my last semester of college and I’m $100,000 in debt for a fucking art degree that I’m not gonna use cause i wanna do music but I have no motivation feeling defeated and STUPID😹😹😹💔💔💔

I can’t sleep but I’m so tired, my city is on fire and everyone at my university is just going on with their days like everything is normal and I haven’t been personally affected by the fires but it’s still stressful and my best friends brother committed suicide 1 year ago from Monday and I just have to go to school and pretend like I’m not about to end it all. I have class from like 9am-8pm every day this semester and it makes me want to die because I hate the school of my major it’s so depressing and I’m only in college because my parents want me to be and it’s the socially acceptable thing to do and it’s my last semester so I just need to tough it out. I feel like I’m wasting time because I want to pursue a career in entertainment but I also want to do nothing just rot and watch movies all day. Also my mother is uBPD and I just spent winter break with her and had to endure her emotional abuse towards me and my baby sister. Trying to quit vaping and it sucks. idk I haven’t felt this bad in awhile. Also thinking about how this time last year I was at my lowest point ever mentally (super suicidal) and I’m starting to feel triggered by that. Maybe I have seasonal depression idk what to do I’m crashing the fuck out. Maybe I should skip class tomorrow and just rot but then I might get even more anxious about being behind. FUCK ME IN THE ASSSSSSSSS LIVING IS EXCRUCIATINGLY EXCRUCIATING 😝
