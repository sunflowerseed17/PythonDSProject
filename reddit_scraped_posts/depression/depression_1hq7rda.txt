My shiba been staying with my mom for the past couple months. She has been feeding him freshly cooked chicken everyday. 
Fresh I mean fresh, she will wake up at 5 am to prepare his breakfast.

Now hes home and won eat anything that hasnt been made in couple last hours and it needs to ne a chicken. He wont eat any dog food nor granules I tryed buying even the more expensive stuff that he liked.

Anyone has any ideas how can I fix this? I dont have time making him food 3 times a day
