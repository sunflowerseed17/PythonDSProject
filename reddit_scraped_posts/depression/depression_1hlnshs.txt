Absolutely horrible quality picture but:

-turkey with gravy (kinda light amount of gravy)
-salad (cheese, pepper, idk looks mostly like lettuce. Has a little bit of ken’s steak house light northern italian dressing)
-2 Hawaiian rolls (only one pictured)
-carrots with some sweet sauce on it
-box stuffing
-pineapple ring 

Calorie estimating app says 500 but i really don’t believe that’s anywhere near correct
