Some days I feel terrible and miserable and I wish I was dead but some days I feel fine for most of the day especially when I'm with my friends or something but even on those days happiness usually dies down completely by night

On the nights I really really hate everything I cut myself with my razor but I don't do it deep I feel like I do it to just see the blood and to hurt myself a little and I always feel bad about it when it hurts in the mornings anyway

I don't know if I'm actually depressed or if I've somehow tricked myself into thinking I am
