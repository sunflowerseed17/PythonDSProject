I have a 15 GC and am looking at getting a hitch.The door says 6000lbs and I plan on hauling no where near that 1000-2000 at most(Mostly some push mowers,wood,maybe a riding mower at times).Im hoping to just get a little 6' trailer since the trunk in this car ain't very tall but is still spacious.Im just curious how these cars do with a trailer and if you have any suggestions on a hitch.
