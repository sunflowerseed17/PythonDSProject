Been battling this beast for too long. Genuinely think this is it. Fucked up too much to overcome or forgive myself. Almost had it beat too but the person I am didn’t deserve it. The people in my life will have to understand. Feel nothing but regret. I’ve lived long enough. I have my plan and I think I’m ready.
