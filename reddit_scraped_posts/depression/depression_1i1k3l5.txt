I am a **20yrs** old man, who is studying law in another city. The first few months were fine, I cooked for myself, I played videogames, went to uni etc...But now, I have 3 weeks till I have to go write my exams.I cant even study for a hour, and I feel like **I am completely out of control of my life,** cant control my bad habbits ( smoke a lot, drink, started smoking weed again, started gambling again ), and I am hopeless, I think there is no chance for me to pass the exams, and I will be so ashamed in front of my parents, because they are paying for everything. I realized this at my box training, because my coach asked if I have anything going on, and I couldnt say anything. I just cant even perform in box, where I felt free and good, because I keep thinking about what if I get hit, 3-4 months ago I wasnt thinking about this, just going and fighting, I loved getting hit, but now I feel like a coward who cant control his own life, who is scared from everything...I broke up with my gf 1 month ago, because we were bored of eachother, and I have no one to talk too. I could say this to my parents, but I think they couldnt understand me as good as some people who was in the same situation. I hope some of you just can give me an advice, or just share your opinions.
