I’m so stressed out about it. My parents are going to get us subs tomorrow for dinner, so that means I’ll be having a 6 inch tuna sub with shredded lettuce, mayonnaise (which i guess is already mixed in the tuna salad idk), and american cheese. But of course local pizza places don’t list calories and tend to give big portions. I feel obligated to eat the dinner when I’m sitting in front of them, and I also have low self control when I’m just offered something rather than making it myself. I’m just stressed out because my calorie deficit is 1,300 at the moment, and I need to eat beforehand as well because I work an 8 hour retail shift and get super fatigued when I’ve eaten 200 calories or less. But what if I eat like a full meal by lunch time and then eat the sub? Will i be over my deficit? Will the sub be higher in calories than my deficit? I’m trying really hard to actually eat at my deficit rather than under, because I used to try to eat a very low amount but it just resulted in me getting nauseous/lightheaded while driving + simply binging more. I used to be super restrictive and was underweight, started binging daily and became obese, and now I’m trying to lose that weight sustainably but it’s so hard to not just turn back to eating little to nothing. I’m just so so scared of going over this deficit and I don’t know if I should just eat nothing and just force myself to get through the work day and an hour of going to the gym after until I eat dinner or if I should allow myself to eat and just hope i’m not eating too much? Then just eat less tomorrow? I hate how scared i am over something so small
