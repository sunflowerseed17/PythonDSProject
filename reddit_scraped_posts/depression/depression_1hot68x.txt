Okay so we were on a road trip and like you know obviously you gotta stop and go to the loo sometimes right?


Well we stopped by at a town near a lake, it's just past Christmas and New Year's around the corner so obviously traffic is a nightmare with parking lots full and a large queue at the public bathroom as everyone else is trying to do the same thing.


Well after waiting several minuites in this queue the bathroom finally opens (it's one of those 1 person only bathrooms hence the long line) well before I even get close the door some random ancient looking guy barged in, locked the door with ME INSIDE pulled his pants down and started peeing in the bathroom when it was MY turn, I just stared at him awkwardly and he even had the audacity to stay and wash his hands, he has been washing for a very long time he wasnt even talking or giving me eye contact he was for some reason very very concentrated in washing his fucking hands when it is my turn to use the bathroom, I really need to go to the toilet but I cant with him just standing here minding his own buisness unresponsive to whatever I do like this it's become so awkward and anxiety inducing so I got fed up, unlocked the door, and leave it wide open so the whole world can see his pants lazily covering half his ass and left. I was so tempted to just push him out of the bathroom
