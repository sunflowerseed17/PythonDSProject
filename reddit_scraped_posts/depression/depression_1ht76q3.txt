This is going to be really long so thank you so much for reading all of this. It is actually 5 am I have an exam in 2 days and I can't sleep I'm stressed and I'm overthinking as usual. But I think I really needed to talk about all of this somewhere.

Hi, I’m 22, and my life has felt completely out of control since COVID. Before the pandemic, I was the kid who “never failed.” My dad pushed me to be a machine, and at 15, I started studying physics at university. I wanted to be an engineer, but it wasn’t available in my town, so I settled for physics. I didn’t love it, but I worked hard because I thought that’s what I had to do and I knew that eventually I would transition to engineering once I get the physics bachelor degree. I would be old enough to have a dorm in another town without parents having a look on me etc... and continue my studies.

Then COVID hit, and I failed for the first time in my life. It completely shattered my confidence and gave me massive anxiety. I started overthinking everything, and it’s like I lost the focus and discipline I used to have. Three years later, my dad passed away from cancer while I was still struggling academically. We weren’t close for a long time after my parents divorced when I was 13, but in the year before he died, we started rebuilding our relationship. Losing him hit me harder than I expected because it felt like I lost him just as we were starting fresh.

Around the same time, I became estranged from my sisters, who have cut me out of their lives. I’ve been battling anxiety, focus issues, and this crushing sense of loneliness ever since.

In the middle of all this, I met someone—a girl I studied with—who became my closest friend. She wasn’t just a study buddy; she knew more about me than anyone else. I let my guard down with her in a way I never had with anyone before. For the first time, I didn’t feel ashamed to ask for help because I trusted her completely. She helped me regain some structure in my studies, and for a while, it felt like I was finally making progress.

What’s crazy is that before things got complicated, we had so much in common like struggling with anxiety,we have the same hobbies too .She became my motivation. I would wake up at 6 am, work out, and then meet her at the library at 8 am. We’d study, take breaks, and have lunch together. Those moments felt like the best part of 2024, and I was finding peace in the routine. For the first time in years, I felt like I was living a balanced life, and it made everything feel a bit more manageable.

But I fell for her. I thought she might be the one good thing the universe gave me after all these years. Meeting her also helped me escape from the overwhelming thoughts I had about my dad’s death. Before I met her, I was having a lot of nightmares and struggling with grief. She distracted me from that pain, even if it was just for a little while.

Over time, though, she started mentioning her boyfriend more often. It wasn’t every time we talked, but the mentions became more present, and it hurt like a knife every time. The more I heard about him, the more I realized I was just a friend to her, not someone she’d ever see as more.

Eventually, I even saw him in person, and it hit me hard. I had to watch the person I cared about with someone else, and it felt like a gut punch. It wasn’t just about unrequited love anymore—it felt like I was losing her as a friend too, as she seemed to focus more on him than on me.

Now, I don’t know how to proceed. If I get close again, there’s the boyfriend situation, and I can’t keep dealing with that. But when I try to distance myself, she starts acting weird. I feel like when I pull away, she punishes me by ignoring me, deleting messages, or doing little things that make it clear she noticed my distance. One of the most obvious things now is that we share a Discord server, and during our study sessions, she’ll suddenly leave the voice chat without saying anything. It’s like she’s mad or upset, and I can tell. It’s one of those things that leaves me feeling worse, and it’s become one of the signs that she’s frustrated with me.

I’m stuck between wanting space to heal and not wanting to lose the friendship entirely. But it’s hard to be around her when the boyfriend keeps coming into the equation and when I can feel that tension in the air. I know this might sound like I’m contradicting myself, but it’s more complicated than it seems. I feel like I’m stuck in a cycle where I can’t move forward, and I’m not sure what to do.

On top of this, I’m dealing with insecurities. She has more life experience than me—she’s had relationships, jobs, and seems to have everything figured out. Meanwhile, I’ve never had a girlfriend or a job. The reason I never had a student job is that I was always taught to study like a machine, focusing only on my academics, and to get a “real job” once I was done with my studies. I didn’t know how to balance anything else. I’ve been trying to make money through my drawings, but I don’t feel good enough. I feel like I’m failing in every aspect of life, and the pressure is overwhelming.

Someone once told me, “Girls don’t like guys who need help,” and I hate that I internalized that. All these insecurities I have make me feel like a loser, and I absolutely hate that feeling. It’s hard not to feel less than when I compare myself to others who seem to have everything together. But I’m trying to remind myself that needing help doesn’t make me weak—it makes me human. Everyone has their struggles, and it’s okay to ask for help, even if I feel ashamed sometimes.

The other thing is, besides her, my social interactions are extremely limited. I mostly just talk to people in Discord servers or see a few people once every 4 months. Meeting her was a huge part of my social life, and now that things have changed, I feel even more isolated.

I’ve been really relying on the study sessions we have together—she helps me with the courses I struggle with and gives me a bit of structure. Without her, I’d be struggling even more, especially with my anxiety and focus issues. But the dynamic with her has changed so much, and I don’t know how to move forward while keeping my mental health intact.

I want to rebuild myself, become independent, and overcome my anxiety, but I don’t know how to move forward without feeling stuck.

If anyone has advice whether it’s about friendships, handling anxiety, dealing with insecurities or just anything to regain control of my messed up life—I’d really appreciate it. Thanks for reading.
