I’m just starting to wonder now, throughout my whole life girls just never wanted me because I’m ugly and short. But other guys who were short and even uglier than me always got with girls though. 

It annoyed me to no end because I always thought why do I have to be the one that will die alone. Is autism a bigger disqualifier than looks, height and dick size?  

I’m honestly just wishing I was dead, not even in a sad way it’s just because it is objectively my best option, i just don’t know how to make it happen yet. 

I will never be physically desired by a woman. Even if autism is more of a factor going against me rather than the physical aspect. None I it would matter if I was born as a tall, white, curly haired boy that women always lust after. I can never forgive my parents for being young teens that were too foolish to use protection.
