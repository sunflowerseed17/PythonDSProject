So I have been hunting for a remote J2 for about 2 weeks, and after applying, I get a few emails saying that I have been rejected because they do not recruit from my location. They did not mention anything about what locations are eligible nor did they mention anything on their website/LinkedIn, etc. 

Is it just they didn't mention it, so forget it and move on or am I being stupid for not being able to find this out in advance?
