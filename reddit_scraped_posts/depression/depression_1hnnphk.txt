In my engineering program, I met a girl who quickly became my closest study partner. She’s smart, kind, and incredibly supportive. Thanks to her, I’ve become more disciplined and focused, and I genuinely credit her for keeping me on track this year. Without her, I might not even be registered as a student.

But I’ve fallen for her, and she has a boyfriend. At first, I tried to convince myself that I could just be her friend. But every time she mentioned her boyfriend or canceled plans to see him, I felt like my heart was being crushed. Meeting him made it worse—he’s a genuinely nice guy, which only adds to my frustration.

For months, I’ve been stuck in a cycle. We’d have a great time together studying or hanging out, then she’d casually bring up her boyfriend, and I’d spiral. I’d withdraw, telling myself I needed to distance myself, but she’d always notice and pull me back. One day, she mentioned going to see her boyfriend after we finished studying, and it ruined me for hours. I couldn’t eat, sleep, or do anything. Another time, she agreed to grab fries with me after class, only to cancel because she’d forgotten she already had plans with him. That night, I couldn’t focus on anything and just lay in bed, completely overwhelmed.

Things changed in October when we started working mostly online through Discord. Studying virtually has reduced some of the anxiety because we don’t see each other in person as often, but it hasn’t solved everything. We still talk during breaks, and even though I try to keep things professional, conversations inevitably turn to her boyfriend. Hearing about him—even indirectly—still feels like being stabbed in the chest.

The worst part is, I can’t leave. Our study routine is incredibly effective, and I know I’ve grown as a person because of her. I’ve tried to push my feelings aside, telling myself, “It’s just a crush. I can be her friend.” But every time I think I’ve moved on, something small happens, like her mentioning plans with him, and it pulls me back into the same pain.

I don’t know what to do anymore. Cutting her off feels impossible, but staying close to her is breaking me inside. I feel like I’m living in a fantasy where I pretend everything’s fine, but it’s not. I’m stuck between wanting to be her friend and needing to protect my mental health. Either way, I feel like I’ll lose something important.
