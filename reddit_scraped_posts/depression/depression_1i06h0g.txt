29F here. I don’t have any talent at all. I mean I can’t even do regular things properly like keeping my house clean, being disciplined, cooking good food(I cook only average easy to make food). I have no finnesse. I can’t draw or paint. I can’t even cut vegetables properly. I am super clumsy. I don’t have a lot of friends and I am not good at being very social or network. I am not good at studies and I do a very average job and my salary is very average. I am not even street smart. My humour is average. I am not good at public speaking or interviews. I have low attention span now and I am not able to read or write also. I am average looking with average height. My health is not that great and I am also gaining weird now with age. To top it off, I am also depressed, anxious and generally unhappy. My relationship with my parents and sibling is not good. My therapist asked me to make a gratitude journal and I have been writing in it for over a month but it’s not really working. I also feel that I should be dead by now as there is no point.
