For about a little over 3 weeks out of nowhere I got this pain/discomfort in my right upper buttcheek. It then went to my tailbone area and caused discomfort there and then it went to my left upper buttcheek. When I lay down and use heat it donâ€™t feel it at all. Itâ€™s usually when I stand or sit down for periods of time. Sometimes it might feel like itâ€™s burning idk how to describe it. Itâ€™s more of a discomfort but I can still function normally. Anyone had anything similar or are going through anything similar for maybe a peace of mind? Of course I think I think the worst all the time and itâ€™s affecting me ðŸ¥º I can sleep fine. It doesnâ€™t mess with my sleep but as soon as I get up in the morning I can start to feel it again. Any advice would be appreciated. 32F.
