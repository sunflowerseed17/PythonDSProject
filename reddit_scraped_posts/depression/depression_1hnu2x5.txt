My dad was an army medic I love him but he is a psychopath He has told me that they did things to him in military Facilities such as chemical testing and I believe him because his personality is absolutely wacko I have been almost killed in Disneyland Paris Dear two suffocation was a pillow when I tried to stop him attacking my wheelchair bound mother And the first memory I know is being slapped in the face because I laughed which I later came to find out was because my dad was talking about his parents to my older sister who had Passed away some years before however I was less than 3 years old and I did not know any kind of language and I had never actually seen anyone cry or make any kind of face like that and my natural reaction as a child was to just laugh and I was attacked I was attacked all my Life my mother had The same form of muscular dystrophy and she was attacked on a almost daily basis and I was then attacked for trying to stop the attacks while being too weak of course I could not stop the attacks and to this day aged 25 these attacks don't seem to stop even today my wrist has been almost snapped which is always fun anyway thank you for reading My depressing rant
