Loser 

How do bullies really hurt you? By saying something painful but true. I was called a weirdo and a freak in school. Every once in a while, life hits me hard, and I go back to those memories. And I think, they’re right, I am a freak, my life is proof of that, I don’t have what others have, I am somehow fundamentally deficient to others. If I think of that, it feels like my chest is just a sucking hole of emptiness. I spend my life trying to forget those truths. I pretend I’m happy and fulfilled. But deep down, I know, just like everyone else does, that I am a loser. I do not like being reminded of that.
