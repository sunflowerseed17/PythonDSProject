THANK YOU ALL FOR ANSWERING

I have always been insecure about my breasts. They are saggy, and they always have been. The men i am with always tell me they do not mind, but i dont know if they just say that because they feel sorry for me or something.
I plan to do a boob job as soon as i get enough money, but i still have to live with my natural ones for a while...
