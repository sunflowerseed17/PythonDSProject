Feel like I cant go on, depression, so much loss, massage places were my pleasure and now ruin.
I have lost my home, family, health, job , stability.
I want to live but can't find the strength or hope. I don't think I will suicide, it's on my mind, I fear I may get sicker yet and have no choice. 
Can't see a way out
