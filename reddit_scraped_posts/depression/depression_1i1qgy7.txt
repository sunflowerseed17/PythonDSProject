I just hate them so much, they give false hope. I had many of them last year, moments when I was just happy, but even those were not perfectly happy as the main cause of my sadness was always on the back of my head. But these moments gave me false hope and because of that I didn't go through with my suicide plan. There were also other factors like I was scared and that it would have caused my family pain but I do regret not doing it, it would cause my family much more pain if I do it now than if I had done it then so I don't think I'll do it.
