I have a 15 limited and it's snowing where I'm from. Naturally I went to a large open parking lot after work and did some donuts.They weren't very impressive since the car is awd but the traction control kept coming on. YES I turned it off and dosen't feel as aggressive as with it off but the light kept popping on that my car was slipping and making that grind noise.Why is this?
