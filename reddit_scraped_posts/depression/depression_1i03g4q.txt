I feel exited whenever I read the news of someone dying because it always make me happy to imagine that death is unexpected and that could be my name their instead.

“ XX died in a car accident”

“XX died of heart attack”

“ XX and all her family members died in a plane crash”

Just to be clear, I don’t like seeing other people dying but I just wish my name was written their instead.

And I am not famous so there won’t be any news about my death but it’s still nice to imagine.
