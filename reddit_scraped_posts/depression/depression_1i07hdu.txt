Honestly I (f19) dont even care if someone ever reads this I just need to get it out. I have been feeling very down lately and me having no passion or talent at all makes me feel depressed and useless as everyone around me seems to be doing fine and I am the one that is just really depressed and think about suicide all the time. I just try to push through and think maybe this time it will be different but it just never is that way and I cant do anything to fix myself to be less depressed. I’ve literally almost tried everything but having no passion or talent at all in life and also being really dumb in school makes me really frustrated and also angry. I feel like if something were to change it is only to make me even more depressed as I have been feeling like this for so many years now and even my mother jokes around my suicidal thoughts which just really doesn’t help because I try to avoid these thoughts (even though they come up all the time). I know I should be grateful for what I have but being here just doesn’t feel like its for me and if I could change places with somebody just so that I can be finally free it would be the best. I don’t know. I feel like its never gonna get better.
