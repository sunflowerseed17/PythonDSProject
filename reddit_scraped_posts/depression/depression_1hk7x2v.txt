I have like 100 hrs in the game now. I've played Germany numerous times while learning the game and I have a decent enough understanding of things like the navy, air, focuses, all that, but im never really good at implementing them. I tried playing Poland and got rolled by Germany twice, I tried forming Austria Hungary as Hungary and got bullied by Czechslovakia. This is all on the easiest difficulty by the way. What are some good countries to do and good focuses to go down while still a beginner, losing on the easiest difficulty is so cringe.
