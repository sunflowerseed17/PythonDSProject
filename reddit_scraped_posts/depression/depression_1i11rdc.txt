I,m a 52 M who s suffering depression/anxiety after many years.I have recently been given medications that have really helped.  However, I am no longer the horny bugger that my (equally horny love of my life ) girlfriend met.  
I realize that medications do affect the libido and  ask  whether anyone has found some solutions? I know it’s there but i feel like there isn’t an ignition. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Especially from my girlfriend. 

Edit: An ! mark that shouldn’t have been there.
