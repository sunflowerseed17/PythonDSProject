I keep encountering these situations where I'm strolling around in, say a shopping mall for example. Someone then waves at me and says hi (myname)! But I dont recognize them, and I dont even remember their name. Until realizing a few minuites after passing by that hes an old classmate i used to know back in elementary. 


How do I overcome the awkwardness of trying to figure out who they are since it's been so long since you met them? I was considering to ask "hi, do I know you?" But it kinda sounds rude. Any advice? This has happened 7 times now
