Sorry Guys I don't want to ruin your moods and your day by telling you about the miseries of my life but I often get negative thoughts about myself and I usually post in subs like depression, venting, anxiety and mental health but I just wanted to ask you guys what do you think of guys who are complete failures like  me who are just good for nothing and plain bad suck at everything?

Imagine someone in his mid 20s who has no job, no skills, no resume, no degree and no interest in studying or learning things and is a liability on his parents and on the surroundings around him

Would you want such a person to be around you and be friends with? 

I often think that the world would have been better off if I and others like me (if there are any) wouldn't have been born

The world only respects rich, powerful and successful people, it has no place for failed losers like me who are just a burden on everyone around them

I usually prefer to suffer in silence since I know I am anomaly and I don't fit in with others but I wanted to ask your opinion on my thoughts
