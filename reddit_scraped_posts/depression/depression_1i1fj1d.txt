For context, I’m still going to school. I have depression and feeling down lately. I’ve slept trough the past few days. I skipped one day today, because I decided to use the time to write an essay (fell asleep after though). Still did my chores though. My mother gave me hell today, barged into my room and screamed at me like crazy, because I’ve “wasted the past days by sleeping”. Said that I’m a “useless parasite” and everything (only a few weeks ago she told me she was proud I was putting my strength together to go to school everyday). I didn’t give her attitude or anything, was nice to her. How is it my fault for sleeping? It’s not like I willingly decided to. It’s because of my depression and she knows it. I’ve already been having a hard time, don’t need to be screamed at for it as well. So unfair.
