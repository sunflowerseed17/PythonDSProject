hi i’m 14(f) and was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety at 11 years old. Most of my friends tell me i’m also bipolar yet i’m too scared to yet checked out for it. Depression ruined my life to say the least. it was like something snapped once i was in 6th grade and i started sh to try to help but obvi it didn’t. i eventually got help and have been in therapy since. i got better after 6th grade like the summer yet i felt so off. it was weird bc i didn’t know what to do now since depression didn’t occupy my life. i remember vividly laying in bed staring at the ceiling for an hour because i didn’t know what to do or how to return to my normal lifestyle. is this normal?? also what should i do?? i’m also getting into another depressive episode (like every year) and im tired of people telling me that it’ll get better bc it clearly won’t.
