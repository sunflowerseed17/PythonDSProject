We've decided to just be friends. There's no animosity but I do feel pretty sad. I enjoy having a boyfriend, a person in my life that prioritizes me. I get incredibly lonely when I'm single. Everyone else is preoccupied with own lives, relationships, and problems. I'm starting to think I'm not as sad about the break up as I am about the loneliness I'm going to experience in the upcoming days *sigh*.
