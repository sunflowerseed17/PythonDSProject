Ya'll I'm 13 and I'm starting to get desensitized from like every emotion and I mean EVERY emotion. Except sadness cause well... yeah. I'm literally a blank paper. I'm never really happy or disgusted or angry etc. My mother died when I was 7 (she was 27) I'm living with my father since and sometimes shouts at me but rarely hits me. And I can't cry because I held it in since my mother died. So I'm kinda asking on how to gain emotions back.
