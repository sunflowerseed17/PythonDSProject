- Being able to give your spouse hats to wear.  ( they can turn them down if they don’t like them ) 

- Your kids being able to reach Vincent and Jas’s age along with new cutscenes that involve your kids. They would also start getting taught by Penny.

- Coco bean plants to make chocolate which then can be made into chocolate cakes and other new chocolate based sweets, this would add a new processing machine called the “chocolatier”. Chocolate would sell pretty good. 

- Spouse statues, just incase you’re so obsessed that you want more than just a spouse portrait lmfao. They can come in variations of all the metals, copper, iron, gold, Iridium.
