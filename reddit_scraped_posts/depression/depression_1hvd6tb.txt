I think my step unc actively hates me. He lives here and everytime he sees me he calls me an attention seeking lazy ass that always makes up petty excuses for not doing chores on time and cries into a fit if I'm told to do something (i dont), I'm really trying my best to keep up with chores but his constant comments on how I do it is always discouraging me.


Today was rough for me though, last night I had planned everything i was going to do that day, down to the very hour, so that I dont lose track of time at all. I planned to do the laundry at the evening after I done everything else since to me it's the most time and energy consuming so it's best to do it at night where the next thing on the list is sleep.


Welp, my step unc came barging in again doing his usual bullying on me, he asked me why dont I give a fuck about anything in this house? Well I said that I was actually gonna do the laundry at the evening so that it doesnt mess up my day schedule, he said fuck your schedule, you get done when I tell you to, how are you gonna explain this to your future boss when you start full time? He insists that I am lying to him, and the only reason why I thought of doing the laundry today was because he shouted at me to do it, and if he didnt i would have just stayed at my room playing video games. 

Mate.. I planned all of this since yesterday.. And now your claiming that your verbal abuse to me is necessary to keep me to doing my tasks?  How tf do I convince him that "rotting in my room playing video games" is not what I dream of doing all day?
