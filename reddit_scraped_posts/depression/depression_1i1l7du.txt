My mom and dad are very loud towards me, my mom has ruined every single friendship i’ve had in the past year, she thinks i don’t care about her and she thinks i hate her, but i feel like i can’t confess that she ruined my life, i’m 14 and i feel like i can’t ever clean or leave my room, i’ve been homeschooled my whole life because my dad says school isn’t safe, i didn’t do school for 5 years and i just started an online program but that hasn’t helped, i can’t make friends or go outside because my mom says she doesn’t trust me, i don’t know why because i’ve been going outside for years until i started staying in my room more, i feel very lonely and i can’t keep friendships for more than 3 days because of my mom, i play a lot of vr which is where i make most of my friends but i haven’t used that in 2 months because my mom is just very strict, she keeps threatening to take off my door and take all of my stuff, she won’t let me do anything, i’ve told her that i’m depressed but she doesn’t believe me and doesn’t get me help, i don’t know what to do and i have been having many suicidal thoughts hundreds of times a day.
