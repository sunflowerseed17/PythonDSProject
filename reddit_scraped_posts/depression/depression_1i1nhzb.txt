I sometimes imagine myself as a successful and well known entrepreneur, being interviewed and then I start raising an awareness about an impact of bad parenting, as I faced difficulties growing up and living with my grandparents. Here's a speech I imagine myself delivering to the whole world

"Growing up wasn’t smooth for me. My parents split up when I was around 5 or 6, and from that point, my dad was barely in my life. I’d see him maybe five or six times a year, but it was never because he wanted to build a connection. He just happened to show up with whichever child he was living with at the time. He had kids with two other women—two with each—and we rarely interacted with those siblings. There’s even one sibling I haven’t seen in years. Yet somehow, he carried himself as though everything was perfectly fine.

Looking back, it’s obvious he didn’t care about his responsibilities as a father. His contributions were laughable—he’d buy us clothes once a year: a single pair of sneakers, a couple of t-shirts, and some pants. That was the extent of his “support.” No food, no help with daily needs—nothing. We had to fend for ourselves. Seeing him just a handful of times a year was the norm, and honestly, it felt meaningless. If calling this out makes people uncomfortable, so be it—that’s the truth.

How can a parent justify living like that? Shopping for yourself daily, eating daily, while having no idea whether your kids are eating or not? How does one sit comfortably with that? It’s baffling. Being a father isn’t just about showing up occasionally or pretending to care. It’s about being present—financially, emotionally, and in every way your children need. If you can’t fulfill those roles, then you don’t get to act like you’ve earned the title of “good parent.”

Neglecting your kids isn’t something to ignore or excuse. You can’t disappear, show up when it suits you, and then pretend you’ve done enough. If you’ve caused harm, you need to face it, own up to your mistakes, and work to make things right. That’s why I’m sharing my story—it matters. Too many people put on a facade of being good parents when their actions show otherwise. It’s important to expose that truth so others can understand the real consequences of neglect.

I’m not looking for sympathy, and I’m not dressing up the reality of what happened. This is my story, and it shaped the person I’ve become today. People need to recognize that this behavior isn’t acceptable. Excuses don’t erase responsibilities, and running away from them doesn’t shield you from the damage you cause. It’s time we hold people accountable for their actions—or lack thereof."

Wish my dreams could come true so that I can make others aware as I'll be an influential person because of my success. Bad parenting can really grow hatred in children. It's heartbreaking 💔
