Yes okay. I understand that you love your cars, and your turbo charged EJ25 box engine with aftermarket mufflers sounds great. But please dont redline your car at 2 am. You scared the shit out of me and I had a terrible sleep last night. I kindly ask to those who do this to redline your engine earlier in the night, or in rural areas where their are not many houses nearby. I get that your showing off but doing it when everyone is already asleep just makes you annoying. Thankyou for your consideration
