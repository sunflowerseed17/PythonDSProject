Ever since I was like 4, people have always asked me or my relatives, if I have ADHD. I think it's because I'm super hyper, can't concentrate, overthink way too much, bla bla bla. But whenever I have asked my parents if they could go and see if I could get tested, they just say no. Which sucks, cuz recently, I've been overthinking way too many things like, does she like me, why do I sound like this, why do I look like this, what am I doing with life, stuff along those lines.
