Small vent but just now my iron, which is stored on a shelf, somehow fell. 
It managed to fall in a straight line with the top part facing down, right onto my big toe-bone. The first two seconds are sheer shock but the pain. Geez. I couldn’t cry because I did not want to upset the kids but it is a genuine ‘I’m a grown woman but Imma have a little cry’ pain. The way I was moving laundry means that had this been ten seconds earlier, it would have hit me in the head.
How the hell did this thing fall exactly that way? Which part of the universe did I piss off? So yeah, ouch.
