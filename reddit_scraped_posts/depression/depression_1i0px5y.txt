I just found out today that me and almost 100 other people will be laid off. 
I’ll be 36 years old next year and I’ve never worked for a company that didn’t lay off people after max 2 years. It’s so sad and scary. I feel like inside of me there is a black hole that is eating me up. Most of my adult life I’ve been job hunting and sending hundreds of applications . I never worked at a company longer than 2 years because that’s when layoff rounds start. I know it’s not only happening to me but the overall outlook of my past decade as an expat in Germany is very grim. I learned German and invested a lot of effort to lead a normal life, first of which means to be employed. I went to two bootcamps and they ended up with job offer for me but it’s no use since all companies dissolve after short time. They say you’re safe in Germany but it’s so not true - all my contracts (except internships) have been unlimited , permanent contracts but it means nothing. 
I have no family and I dont dare to start one because how can I raise a child if I constantly have to job hunt? Yes I end up with a job , at least for a while, but after 10 years of such life I feel so much older …. I am a UX designer by profession (previously worked in another area of design).  As I said, I speak German, I know the system, I have been laid off countless times so I know it’s temporary but the whole lifestyle of insecurity and inability to save any kind of significant life changing amount is eating my soul….
