I want a place where i can develop myself and grow without being stifled/frightened/belittled by outside factors. 

I have to allow myself to feel 

depressed, confused, anxious, distracted, lethargic, forgetful, overwhelmed, demotivated.

Only by allowing myself to have those feelings without feeling bad about them i can start to think what to do to be able to function when i am in those states. 

You must learn to accept yourself. 

Only then you can function within yourself. 

If you don't accept yourself you will be busier with trying to fix what is "wrong" with you rather than learn to function within your own boundaries.
