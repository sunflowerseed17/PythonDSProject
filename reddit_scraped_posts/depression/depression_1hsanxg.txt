Lost my family and home, I did it for sex. Short term pleasure at cost of family and home. Alone in dingy apartment my life is not worth living, I have lost all hope. I don't belong anywhere. All my motivation is gone, no more gym or swimming. My son told me I would regret leaving, he knew more than me. I'm a sex addict and it's ruined my life, caused so much pain to others with my lies and betrayal. I am sick and dead inside. Suicide looks like the only way out. I still want to live but my life is miserable and se no way out.
