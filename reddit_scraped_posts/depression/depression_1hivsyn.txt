This is so embarrassing but I am on the verge of sending a pathetic begging text to my ex to give us a chance. He’s already told me he doesn’t want me but I want to fight for things.  And today was really tough because my asshole neighbor complained about my dog barking way out of proportion to the situation and in a way that triggers me.  I am so distressed. All I want to do is for us (my ex and I) to give it a real go and see what is possible   Maybe just typing it here will be enough.
