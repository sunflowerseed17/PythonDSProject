i lost my job again, a month or so ago. im facing losing my car now. i am trying to apply for disability, because my mental health is really making it difficult to work, to live. my mom says i am only going to be diagnosed with "being lazy." she keeps insulting me, and sprinkles in the "you need to find work" in between the insults. i just dont care anymore. i feel nothing. im in debt. i have nothing. i just want to lay in bed and disappear. im just tired all the time. i know im not lazy, her words dont mean much to me. im just too tired to really think or do anything about it. insults do not make me want to prove someone wrong. im 26. i spent the last decade *trying* to prove her words wrong. i just dont care anymore. im just tired of feeling this way. how do normal people have such a range of emotions? i wish i had the energy for that.

  
idk

vent i guess.
