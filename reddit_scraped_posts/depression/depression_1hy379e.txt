I just feel so dirty, sticky, unclean all the time. Before I atleast felt clean after taking a bath and felt pretty clean for the whole day except when it came the time to bath again. But now I just want to bath like 5 times a day and scrub my body red everytime. And I feel dirty most in my own room because I always find some flaws in it, it's never perfectly clean. I do have ocd so maybe it's because of that but my ocd was never like this, it has always been random routines that I have to follow everyday and other compulsions not this, could this be because of my ocd?
