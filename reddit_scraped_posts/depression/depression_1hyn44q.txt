I don't work in film industry, I just act irl.

Acting like everything is fine, when I don't think it is yet.

Lying to parents that I have sobered up.


Acting like I am having a great time, when I am barely holding myself together.


Funny how nobody can see through my act, maybe I'm a good actor.
