I used to have a long list of passions, hobbies, and creative pursuits, but none of them hold my interest anymore. Everything I do feels unbearably tedious and banal. Its as though I have forgotten how to have fun, or feel any positive emotion at all. 
At the request of my therapist, I have been forcing myself to go out every weekend for the last few months. I signed up for social events, tried new activities, met strangers, attempted to date. I have yet to form any friendships or meaningful connections. 
I have no career, no home, and no valuable skills. My self esteem is virtually nonexistent, and I see no future for myself. If I were to suddenly vanish off the face of the Earth, I don't believe anyone would notice or care much about my absence. 
How can I possibly build something out of nothing?
