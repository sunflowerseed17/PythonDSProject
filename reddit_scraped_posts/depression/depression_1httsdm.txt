I quitted in September. Finally I am seeing the end of this. I thought 'hey let's make a post on this subreddit ' while I was writing another post about how I want to kill myself and I better find some drugs to numb myself.

So here you have it. I am not addicted to benzos anymore.
You can do it ! The worse for me was how addicted I was psychologically.

Good luck
