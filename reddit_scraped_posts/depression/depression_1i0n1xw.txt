Hi, im 27f ive had depression for a long time and ptsd after ive been assaulted in 2021 at my workplace , I haven't work full time since ,.. i did try to go back to school didnt work out and i was working a bit part time for a couple of months but  i fell back in depression since then its been a year and now i need to find a new job and work and live normal again everyone except me to live normal again i just dont know how.. im embarrassed to say that i just want to sleep im tired and stressed, i do want to have a normal life but in the same time im scared ill never go back to being myself or fail at the job and then they fire me because im not good enough , .. i have bills to pay.. anyway i feel like people keep judging me when i say that I haven't worked in a while.. i thought i was doing better but now i feel like depressionn is coming back. I feel alone with those feelings..
