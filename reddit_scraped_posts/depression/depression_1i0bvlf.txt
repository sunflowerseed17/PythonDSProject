I have been lying to my parents and friends for years and they expect me to graduate in May. fuck. i’m so sick. and I know it. pray for me. please pray for me.
I started smoking weed a little after
I told my parents I was going to school. I dropped out after two years to be a musician. but because I am so inconsistent i just released my first album. people can’t even hear the words I am saying because I have been so depressed I stopped caring about myself and allow myself to get sick. I procrastinate on everything and it is killing me. I can’t be proactive. people prey on me because of my mental weakness. they can sense it and it doesn’t stop. even children know it. I go to work at a daycare and the kids belittle and bully me and I don’t even care. because that’s how everyone treats me. 
i am realizing that making progress in music is about connecting with people and I cannot connect with people. when people see me they just turn their heads to not even look at me. I can’t talk. I was hanging out with this girl and she said I was strange because if the convo went on for too late I would just shut down.  i’ve been depressed since childhood and it’s not stopping. facing the fact that I am far behind everyone else in my life. and I can’t stop lying. I lie to make myself seem better than I am because I know how pitiful my life is. i’ve never won anything. I don’t know if i’m good at anything. I just want this tension in my body to stop. i’m scared. so scared.
pray for me.
