I was doing so much better for at least a year (I can’t keep track of time), but now I’m feeling stuck in pointlessness again. I was making more friends and getting more things done, but now I’m worrying my friends don’t care about me and my small attempts to fight the laziness are coming to nothing. 

I’ve been working for a friend, and although I want the money and I like helping and hanging out with him, it’s only my desire to not let him down that’s keeping me motivated enough to show up. I know I’ve improved, but I don’t like this job and definitely don’t want to continue this for too long. It all seems pointless anyways. 

I’ve also been hoping to find deeper relationships, which feels impossible in my current perspective. It seems anytime I’m sharing my struggles I’m either oversharing, or using it as a joke. 

I recently was hoping I could go back to living without medication, so I decided with my doctor to begin reducing my dose. Just one step in and I’m already sliding back. I feel pathetic and worthless to need a numbing dosage to function. I am wondering though if it could simply be me going through a withdrawal (Idk if that’s the right word)? 

Thinking this through, I think I’ll get back to my previous dosage and see if that makes things better again. Half of me hates that idea because I feel like I’m suppressing myself, but logically I’m just reducing my dwelling on the negative.
