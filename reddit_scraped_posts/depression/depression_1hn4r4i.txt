I'm 20 and undocumented with scoliosis/ chronic back pain so I can't get job a at retail like Walmart and also restaurante like chik fil a because of the undocumented part and I also can't just work labor like construcci√≥n because of my back and tarde school and college are to expensive because I don't get help from government to pay so I've recently been experimenting with other ways of making money like the whloe e commerce thing with dropshiping and stuff like that I'm not to sure about this route so I have recently tried mobile car detailing wich is like on paper but physically I don't like it one bit but this seems my most viable route all need to do is advertise a bit locally and wait to get clients and I can make good money 

What would you guys do if you where in this position 1. Just man up and do the detailing no matter the pian or look for a different route i actually fully enjoy
