For context, I (24f) have been broken up with by someone who I am completely in love with. It goes beyond anything I’ve felt for someone before. It happened at the start of November.

I’ve been broken up with before and it always hurts due to my anxious attachment but never like this. I’ve always been okay until now. This is the first point in my life I’ve seeked therapy.

What I’m feeling now has surpassed heartbreak and I actually look like back at all the times I thought I was depressed and laugh at how minor that felt to now. I’ve never been a depressed kind of person, I’ve always been mentally strong. 

For two months now I have not changed at all and feel this dull, blocked feeling. I feel mentally claustrophobic. I’ll be sat on my bed, or in the shower or staring at myself in the mirror just absolutely sobbing at how scared I am that I’m going to feel this dull and unhappy forever. The break up is one thing but experiencing this complete loss for life and ever feeling joy or excitement is a whole other thing. 

I feel like the person I was before this all happened has just completely died. I don’t carry any of the same positive beliefs anymore such as ‘things get better for everyone’. And instead just think it’s actually a coping mechanism for everyone and now my perception of life terrifies me. 

I feel like I’ve hit a wall and despite everything I’ve ever believed, realised that actually life is not guaranteed to be great and I’m not guaranteed to feel better ever again. Just because I want something does not mean it exists. I don’t know what to do anymore.
