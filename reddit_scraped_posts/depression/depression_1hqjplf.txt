Title: My plan is: after I reach ~30, when my parents passed away, I will end my life, so I will not exist in anyone's memories anymore, and I can finally stop the pain of existing.

I rlly value my family, they are the only motivation that keeps me living, i dont want to see them cry after me if i die too soon. Before they leave me I will cherish every living moment with them, so they can leave happily and I will not regret.
