Sorry in advance I can’t tell a story to save me life.  

I switch between personalities/adopt personalities and characteristics

I have a very unstable emotional state 
I’m a very sensitive person a wrong word or slight and I want to stab you. 

I don’t show it and can hide it from people however I seriously know I have a problem I have wanted to hurt people over saying the slightest insult or dig to me 

I’m friendly and outgoing and happy to joke and have banter with my colleagues or friends and family In my most recent job over 14 colleagues have have added me on socials and are always very happy to chat to me 

However I can’t say I like them or that i even care about them it’s the same with family and friends I have no emotions with them 

However my brother is leaving for the army and I can feel tears in my eyes when he brings it up but I don’t feel anything furthermore whenever my mum shouts at me I cry.

However I can be depressed very much so and I do go to dark places mentally 

I can’t say I know how to make friends or even talk to people 

I have friends and they ask me to hangout all the time but I never do and never have.

Supervillain 🦹‍♀️ backstory !

Depressed narcissist bipolar Single mum 19 and drug addict abusive father and Brother with multiple behavioural conditions.

Long story short 
Me from the ages of 0-18 I was left alone
Never allowed to leave the house. 
Never allowed to have friends at my birthday and visa versa
Never left the house 

I came home and play video games by myself 
Wasn’t allowed hobbies or sports
Never left the house even on Halloween 
My routine everyday for 18 years was school and video games 
I tried killing myself 3 times 
First 8 my father beat me then 15 my only friend died then 16 
was after my father SA me 

I had a mental breakdown when covid started and that’s when I started having my behavioural issues ironically I started making friends at college and work round about that time

Brother had to have all the attention sports school at home everything 
My dad was in and out the picture 
My mum worked 60 hours a week and was always exhausted 
She was paying of my fathers debts 100,000£

I think my issues come from the loneliness and depression and maybe I just gave out 🤷‍♀️ 

I’m not sure though because like how tf can people describe me as friendly and like me when I literally didn’t have friends or talked to anyone for well over a decade I was the kid that sat at table by myself everyday kinda thing👀💀🤷‍♀️

Every job I have I can seemly integrate and make friends but I have no feelings and I don’t understand how I’m so liked 
I feel out the place all the time 

I analyse people their habits and their likes and dislikes I’ve noticed that as I work I think about what someone says and I play it through my head. I think I’ve developed some sort of “I need this person to like me trait” I think the years of loneliness might have made me develop something 🤷‍♀️

I just feel like a freak like I’m watching everyone I kinda feel like that character from the series YOU just less date rape.

Ps I’m transgender male to female and 20 years old 

I’m really not sure what to say or really what the purpose of this post is 🤷‍♀️ I think it’s too vent but honestly I want help I want to change it but I’m scared of therapy I can’t stand the idea of the therapist telling someone my business and tbh I don’t think i could talk about my emotions or feelings to someone.
