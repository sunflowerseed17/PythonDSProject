So I found this weird cd of kendrick at my local music store, which I HIGHLY suspect to be a bootleg mixtape(idk much about all his mixtapes tbh). After a listening, it's basically the Training Day mixtape with some tracks having different names for no apparent reason, with the Control song, along with some remixes from other rappers hopping on the beat. Am I the only one with this? And also, unrelated, but does somebody knows where to buy a cd of Training Day anywhere safely?
