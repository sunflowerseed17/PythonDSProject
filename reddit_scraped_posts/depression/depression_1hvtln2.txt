I'm a horrible person. Like literally I wish I wasn't like this. I get irritated easily and yell at people. I feel like I give people evil eye. There is not a single thing I do right. I yell at the people I love most. Today I yelled at my brother. My mother who sacrificed her entire life for me just wants me to be kind to her and be a successful person and make her proud and I can't even do that. I just cause her trouble every single day, I yell at her and she forgives me everytime but still we have drifted apart. I even yelled at my tuition teacher today, who was genuinely one of the best teachers I know and always so fun. I had so much fun at his class. But after me yelling he was cold and distant. I want to kill myself so bad but still my family and friends would be hurt, and I don't want to cause them that hurt but I'm so tired of living with myself.
