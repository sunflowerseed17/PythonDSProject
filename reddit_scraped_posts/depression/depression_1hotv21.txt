This shit pisses me off so much genuinely. I’m not just talking about a minor 2 hours without responding, like that’s fine I’m not annoyed about that. I mean like 12+ hrs, days, or weeks. Why is it so hard to just simply text someone back/respond to them rather than ghosting? If you’re not interested in talking to them any longer then just tell them that. “I’m scared of hurting their feelings” ghosting is 100x worse than being honest I guarantee you that. You can still be honest in a nice and respectful way without being a jerk. 


If you don’t know how to do that, then work on it and stop using the whole “I don’t know how” or “I’m really bad at communicating” as stupid excuses. Pisses me off especially when adults are ghosting other adults, like we’re not children anymore, why can’t you use your words to communicate? “But I have depression” or “I have mental health struggles”  I have depression, and if i were to regularly ghost people, I wouldn’t be surprised if they got annoyed of me after a while. 


If it’s just once it’s fine but when it becomes a habit that’s when it’s annoying and ridiculous. JUST USE YOUR FUCKING WORDS AND TEXT/CALL/WHATEVER METHOD OF COMMUNICATION THE PERSON BACK LIKE A MATURE ADULT
