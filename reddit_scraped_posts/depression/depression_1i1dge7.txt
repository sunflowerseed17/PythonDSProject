As a kid I had dreams and dedication that by the time I'd get to this age of 21 (if I got to the age I am) that I'd be someone spectacular by now. I know what you're gonna say, it's unrealistic to be held on by the past you, but I just can't help but think how bad and boring my life has become. I'm unemployed and struggling to find work, while I barley have any friends to ever talk to or hang out with, and when I do hang out I feel so disconnected from life, or even when I'm playing a game with someone it's like i can't bring myself to enjoy it. 

It feels like I'm constantly bored of everything too, I try to force myself to try to do something or play something or even watch something and my brain just blocks it out like it's not something it wants to do.. 

I feel like I'm failing my mom, as I'm just in my room all the time over thinking about what to do with my life everyday, and it's honestly exhausting. Having ADHD and depression mix together is not a fun mix...I feel like I'm going nowhere in my life. What can I do?
