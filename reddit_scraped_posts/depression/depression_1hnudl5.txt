So I'm replaying the trilogy as femshep to romance Garrus on ME2 and I refused Liara on her dialogue and then I pick every "mean" option towards her on conversation with her, however now that I'm going towards Ilos she came to my room and just started to talk like we were in a relationship??? 

I told her to back off here too but I want to know if this still counts as romance....
