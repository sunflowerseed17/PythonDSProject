I've been told constantly to "get your life together" and "You need to have more discipline". I just don't have it in me. It's impossible. I've been born a loser to play video games and escape from reality. People say, "Just do it", but why the fuck is it so hard to even get in the right mentality? I need to have discipline but where do you find that discipline within anyway? I fail to try to try. I never realized it but I'm so miserable so I just escape and live an unhealthy lifestyle and accept that I can't possibly change because I'm me. Whenever someone brings up the lifestyle I'm living and why it's wrong, it bothers me because I know it's the reality so I push it to the side and turn it into toxic positivity. "That's just the way I am" "It's fine everything will work out" That's not optimism, it's fucking delusion and I know it. I'm so sensitive that hearing the truth and being told what I need to do gives me depression rather than motivation. I was raised by such great parents yet I'm such a dissapointment due to this thing called discipline. This is only an observation of mine. Hopefully someone can relate.
