you are probably right.

i am jealous of many around me.

they simply have a better life than i do. they are better than me. and they can handle hardships well.

whereas i am just some broken, miserable monster. 

but then again. i do not desire anymore, only spite, despair, misery and whatever negative emotion i forgot to name.

i do not deserve to live, much less exist.

even when i tried my best, it didn't really amount to anything

i honestly just want to spend a
few years of my life just rotting in bed and playing some video games. could care less about self improvement.

i was not enough. never will be. i choose to give up. i beg to whichever god is merciful enough to listen. kill me. put me to eternal sleep. preferrably just before college.
