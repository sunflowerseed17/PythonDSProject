I’m losing that spark. You know the one. That slight rush that makes things worth doing. Anything really. I was using food to cope. I’m usually very health conscious but since October I’ve been just eating whatever I wanted just to help give myself dopamine boosts throughout the day but I’m losing interest in even that… I bought a ps5. I hadn’t played any video games really for almost 3yrs cuzz I felt I had out grown them and wanted to work on improving myself but after my personal life crashed and burned close to the end of this past year i figured I’d try and get back into them but it hasn’t made a difference. Probably making things worse as I stay up later trying to get that dopamine kick from playing Madden. Not even sure how much I enjoy it…. I’ve lost all discipline. I’ve fallen victim to all my bad habits in recent months. All my addictions have re established their hold on my psyche. And I am saying all this just to explain that I don’t care. I want to but I can’t even force myself to care that I’m spiraling down a drain of despair. That I’m losing precious moments that could be used to benefit my future by the days and weeks as I continue to set myself back more and more by my new found intense indifference. I don’t care and it’s sad. I can’t care and I feel helpless. I’m a shell of myself. Removed from myself forced to watch my former vessel suffer.
Thanks for coming to my Ted talk.
