Yesterday I had a dream of meeting a friend of mine at a kmart unexpectedly and we were talking about random stuff. Then I woke up, and unexpectedly met another friend at a mall, we were talking about how i met the other guy at Kmart in a dream. Well turns out, THAT was a dream too! I work up again, but this time I stayed home and then my dog suddenly started speaking english to me, it was insane, and then he started mimicking the sound of my alarm clock, and then I realised that was actually my alarm clock. So then I woke up.. for real this time.. that dream though felt like a fricking Matryoshka Doll of dreams happening one after another it was so trippy
