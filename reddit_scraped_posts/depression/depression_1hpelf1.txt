I’ve tried making friends (online friends) to chat with at night, I’ve tried doing hobbies to distract myself from the loneliness, tried watching movies/youtube, tried taking sleeping pills to hopefully sleep early, tried doomscrolling also to distract myself, even tried working out, tried eating as a coping mechanism, etc. I feel like I’ve tried everything but whenever it’s time to go to bed I literally can’t sleep and the loneliness is so much that i feel like crying every night, like I can feel the pain in my chest. Idk what to do please help, I didn’t sleep at all last night bc I just couldn’t sleep and the loneliness only wore off slightly at like 6 am. But by then it was too late to sleep because I had to be up at 7:30 this morning.
