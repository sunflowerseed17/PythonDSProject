Hi, I've been struggling with depression for the past 4 years. I've been in and out of the behavioral health hospital and everyone keeps saying there is a cure for depression. For one, gratitude can help cure depression. But in my life it's harder to think that there is a cure for depression. It's like the misery never ends. There's nothing in life I enjoy, there's nothing motivating enough for me to pursue something. I feel like there's nothing for me in life. I wish I didn't feel this way and I wish there was a button for me to put myself on auto-pilot to do the mundane things in life and naturally find things that interest me. I'm trying to remain hopeful but everyday is a pain to go through, my biggest problem in my life is living through each day. I am getting treatment for my condition though, it's called ECT and it's going pretty well. I haven't completed all the sessions yet though so maybe that's why my quality of life has not improved.
