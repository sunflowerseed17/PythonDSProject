I really need someone now very badly. My upstairs neighbor just told me I was cruel because my dog barks when I'm not home (and let's face it, some dogs are barkers). It's not even all the time, but of course he exaggerates and says it is all the time and non stop. I don't know what to do. And feeling hopeless to do anything about that sort of sucks and I ended an on and off again relationship  with someone a week ago by saying we couldn't even be friends because it's too hard for me. I feel like I've lost the person I care about most in the world outside of my immediate family members. I'm so upset and sad. Please help.
