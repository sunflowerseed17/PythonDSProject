My red blood cells have always had an irregular shape but I was never diagnosed as anemic. Now that I'm pregnant, I apparently have been. 

Has anyone else been diagnosed with anemia during pregnancy? During my bloodwork at 26+5, my OB said I was mildly anemic. He told me that in addition to my prenatal, I need to take "65 mg of Elemental Iron." My One-A-Day prenatal has 27 mg of iron (what kind of iron, I don't know). I had blood drawn today at 31+4 and he said I am anemic and to take "Oral Iron Twice Daily" and "Make sure that the supplement you purchase contains 65 mg of Elemental Iron." Has anyone else experienced this? 

After he said I was mildly anemic, I bought Nature Made Iron 65 mg (325 mg Ferrous Sulfate) but I only took them six times because I'm scared about it being too much. I bought the Needed brand's Iron (ferrous bisglycinate) and each capsule has 13.5 mg (unknown if it's elemental iron or not). I've taken that nine times. 

I'm anxious and scared about taking way too much iron. I'm also scared about how this will effect my baby. I know that there are different types of anemia, one being iron-deficiency anemia. He never tested my iron levels during either OB visit. I guess I'm hesitant to load myself up with a lot of iron if my iron levels are normal. I also can't help but ask if all of this iron will truly fix things. If I take all of this iron, will my anemia be reversed? Will something go wrong with my baby if I take too much iron? If I take too little iron? 

I'm so scared. I don't want anything bad to happen to my baby.
