I’m so sick of how unsensible people are towards self harm. Like, people who self harm are obviously already struggling a lot but some people just really like to make it worse by talking bad about it. 
There are people who like to mock it.
There are people who use degrading terms about self harm( particularly psychiatrists and teachers)
There are people who think they have the right to express their opinion on this topic.
And SO many people talk about people who self harm/used to behind their back.
I’m just so sick of it. It’s so degrading, like I’m not even a proper human.
Why can’t people just stfu about something that doesn’t concern them.
