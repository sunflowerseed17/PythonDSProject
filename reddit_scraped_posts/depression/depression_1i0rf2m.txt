Hi,

As you can tell from the title, nothing makes me happy anymore, no matter what it is. I used to love going out with friends, skiing, playing the drums,… but not anymore.

Even reaching milestones or getting good grades in school doesn’t bring me any joy. Everything feels monotonous and neutral.

My mom and dad try to inspire me to find new hobbies, but nothing seems to help. It’s so frustrating, every day feels the same, with no change at all, and it’s been like this for almost four years.
