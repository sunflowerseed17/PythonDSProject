Hi, I've been depressed for almost 4 years now after being terribly traumatised by a bad case of harassment at work. After almost 4 years of taking meds, I notice that my brain is not working anymore at all. I used to be a pretty good student at school. Now as an adult, I feel stupid as hell... I can't count without using my fingers or a calculator, I can't write correctly, I can't focus more than 5 minutes... Which means I can't watch movies, play video games, I can't read anymore because I don't understand a thing. I don't focus on my environment neither, for example while I am writing this, I am stuck in a train station cause I didn't check if I was at the good place before getting out of the train. I always do dumb mistakes at work cause I forget everyday how to do my tasks correctly. Moreover, I developed hyperacusis and some other things that make my life a nightmare.
All that to say that depression is the worst thing, please don't harass people, be nice, listen to them, so they never have to be depressed. What are the worst side effect you've known cause of meds ?
