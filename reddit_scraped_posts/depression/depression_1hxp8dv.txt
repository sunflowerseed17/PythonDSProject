Cardiac Notes

36F

Common EKG notes from teenage years through adulthood:
-Abnormal EKG: non-specific t-wave abnormality (including flattened or inverted t-waves)
-Abnormal EKG: non-specific st-wave abnormality
-Borderline EKG: low QRS voltage

Echos:
-Normal as adult, LVEF ~50-60%
-History of reduced LVEF ~45% and some LV non-compaction as a teenager

Stress Test:
-Normal with low number of PVCs

2-week Holter test in early 20s:
-multifocal PVCs
-ventricular couplets 
-5-beat and 9-beat runs of NSVT

-Murmur: Grade 1, generally missed except by cardiologists, often only heard in a reclining position 

-Cardiac MRI: no significant findings

-Structural irregularities: pediatric cardiologist told me I had a prominent false tendon and a small, extra flap of tissue, presumably in LV? 

Electolyte abnormalities: 
-must take potassium supplement daily or K gets low and get symptoms such as lip tingling
-Had incident of low K as teenager where hands cramped into fists, could not open fingers, high dose K pill at ER fixed issue 

Other notes:
-extended heat stress and intense physical exertion during military service field training exercises increased number of arrhythmias throughout day
-Used to frequently notice increase of arrhythmias when lying down for bed in 20s
-Had an incident in early 20s when I woke up with PVC every 4th beat or so for many hours. Received IV magnesium, which eliminated arrhythmia. 
-The few times I tried Sativa THC edible, I had what felt like extended, dangerous arrhythmia. If I stick only to Indica, no problems. 

Medications:
-Tried calcium channel blocker in early 20s: increased arrhythmias, had what felt like extended dangerous arrhythmias during 12-mile military ruck march 
-Beta blocker: I take 25mg metoprolol succinate extended release twice a day. I did not used to take meds. But when I started a psych med (Strattera), early 30s, I experienced high resting heart rate (~100), high heart rate during exercise (regularly up to 200), and feeling of sustained arrhythmia during exercise (flip flopping sensation). Also must have been getting a lot of arrhythmias at night- I dreamt every single night of choking, suffocating, drowning, etc. Beta blocker brought all symptoms back down to baseline. Had tried low dose of an ADHD stimulant, but EKG showed inverted t-waves, so psychiatrist said I was not a candidate for stimulants. 

What do I have? Is it harmful? I never really get a diagnosis of anything. 

Thank you.
