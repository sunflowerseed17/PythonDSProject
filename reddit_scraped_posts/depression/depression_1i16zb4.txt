It’s strange how depression shows up differently for everyone. Some people escape by traveling, while others can’t even muster the energy to get out of bed. I used to think—how is that even possible? How can someone not get up? It felt unimaginable until life taught me otherwise.

Everyone around me assumed I was fine because I was always on the move—working long hours, juggling side hustles, staying busy. But in truth, I was just trying to outrun my memories. I wasn’t okay. Far from it.

People questioned me: Why didn’t you go home? Don’t you love your parents so much? Of course, I do. But I just couldn’t. How do you explain the kind of pain that makes you feel physically paralyzed? When someone you were with for 12 years moves on and gets married within months, your world crumbles. You question everything—your choices, your worth, your very existence.

Heartbreak doesn’t announce itself with loud cries. It’s silent, but the wounds are raw, like fresh blood oozing out. And the pain isn’t just emotional; it’s physical. Stomach aches, an upset heart, that suffocating feeling where you can’t breathe—it’s all too real.

I’ve started to realize that moving on isn’t the same for everyone. Some people find a way forward quickly, but what about those of us who feel stuck? What about those who just can’t move on?

I don’t have answers yet, but I’m beginning to see that it’s okay to take time. Healing isn’t a straight path; it’s messy and slow. And maybe, just maybe, that’s okay too.
