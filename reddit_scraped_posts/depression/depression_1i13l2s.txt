Since 2020, I don’t think I’ve felt true happiness. It feels like everything has been bad or sad, and it just keeps getting worse every year. There’s always something new to deal with—family issues, losing my dad, and the girl who recently changed my life but only sees me as the “nice guy” who helps her. She complains about her “awesome life” and her relationship with another guy, while I’m left feeling invisible.

My mental health is a mess. I’m struggling with very challenging engineering studies, dealing with fake friends, and feeling lonelier than ever. It’s like I’ve become a secondary character in my own life.

On top of that, I was hoping to make some income from my hobbies, but that hasn’t worked out either. Now, I’m forced to think about getting a regular student job just to keep going. I’m actively looking for one, but it’s tough to accept because this wasn’t part of my plan—I had hoped to do something more meaningful and creative instead.

I honestly don’t know how I’m still standing after all of this. It feels like I’m banging my head against a wall—no matter how hard I try, nothing gets better. People say, “try harder,” but I feel like I’m already at my limit.

How do you keep going when it feels like no matter what you do, things don’t improve? Any advice or encouragement would mean a lot right now.
