So, Ive been sitting with the fact that I've been avoiding drinking water and realize it probably stems from the 10 years I lived on government 
Housing and the water in the faucet having black flakes and floating white and clear stuff in it. During my time with low income housing they did release a PA that they have tested the water and it was aupposidly fine. But it was gross.

Im not on low income housing anymore. But, I still feel scared to drink the water. ðŸ¥´
