Sure, everything stresses me out but the one thing I cannot stand is negativity, it's the worst. There's constant negativity in my family and it makes me feel like shit. It doesn't have to be directed toward me and I still get stressed and sad. I feel like I have no one, I try to make friends but it's just not working out. And all this stress, I don't know how to vent it out in a healthy way that works for me, I only have unhealthy ways to relieve stress. This seems incredibly stupid to ask how to cope in a healthy way since you could just search, right? I've tried many things but it doesn't work for me. I've tried mediation, note-taking, music, gaming, breathing techniques, listening to calming sounds, it feels like nothing would ever work. I've even tried reaching out to some people I know but they just don't understand. There's nothing I could do about my stress triggers and this negativity, I've just accepted it and wished for better but I don't wanna cope in an unhealthy way anymore
