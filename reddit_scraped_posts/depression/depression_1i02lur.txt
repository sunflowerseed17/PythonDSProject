I've been having stupid shitty mood swings, idk why but it tends to happen a lot when reflecting on just stuff, at how I'm failing a bunch at everything I do. I find it difficult to imagine myself enjoying life, I'd like to have a boyfriend, have friends to hang out with, have a place for myself and a job I could tolerate. 

I'm just venting and hoping someone could tell me I'm useless or something, I don't know what I want anymore, maybe I'm just desperate for affection or approval, I just want to have some clear purpose to someone, make someone's day by me doing whatever they want me to do, even if it's bad for me.
