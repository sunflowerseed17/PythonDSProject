I admit I resisted watching this one for awhile. The premise didn't sound like anything I would enjoy. I saw it on YouTube for free and figured, why not? I ended up being delightfully surprised. When you see it, you realize it's something of a tragedy and romantic comedy. Tragic because a couple falls apart after their son is killed and comedic because an emotionally distant man is comically set in his own ways: He doesn't want chaos and he is both attracted and repelled by the woman who trains his dog. The underlying theme here is people trying to dictate the course of their lives but they end up unhappy because they refuse to allow change to occur. A great observation about life and a rare movie featuring romance that doesn't feel too phony.
