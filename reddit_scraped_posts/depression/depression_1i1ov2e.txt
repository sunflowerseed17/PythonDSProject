ive had depression, extreme anxiety that makes professionals question agoraphobia, social anxiety, and eating disorders for almost 10 years now and all have ruined my life. i dont see myself beating my anxiety, so much so i find comfort in my depression because it gives me an out on not fighting my anxiety. im stuck in my house. i have been for years. i did high school online due to it. i have no friends. i had been suicidal a few times, like seriously suicidal not just passive as thats pretty constant, and yet i never actually attempted. and i dont know why. yeah sure, my mom would be sad and i dont want to do that to her, but i also feel like it’d help her out to have me no longer leech off her. like if i say im so miserable, WHY havent i killed myself yet??? either do it, or get your ass up and get a life. but i dont do either. i dont do anything. at all. i feel stuck in this in between of im too sad to do anything but not enough to actually do it. sometimes i wish for my depression to get worse so then maybe i’d actually finally do it.

or sometimes i feel guilty and think maybe im faking it all which is why i havent killed myself yet. and how dare i label myself with the same name as actual depressed people that have tried to/did kill themselves.
