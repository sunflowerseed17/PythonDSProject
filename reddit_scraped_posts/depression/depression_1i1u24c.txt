So I've been feeling shit for almost 3 years now. 9 months ago I was thinking about suicide bcz I thought I was failing my exams but luckily I passesd. Im almost never present in the moment.The only thing I enjoy is daydreaming. My sleeping schedule is fucked. I cant concentrate on my studies. Guys help me here, the thing is I want to know if Ive symptoms of clinical depression.  I cant tell my parents until Im sure. And please tell me how to approach your parents in matters like this. Like what do I say to them.
