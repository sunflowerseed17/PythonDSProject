I feel like I can't control them. Everytime I am out or interact, as soon as the slightest thing happens where I interpret either a negative response like I'm unwanted, or they don't care about me, I feel like I start cycling. I start thinking about all the times people have made me feel abandoned and it's every single person in my life. Every, single, one.

I keep thinking about what I did to deserve a mother who always made me feel less than. A dad who didn't care about me. Exes who treated me like crap. I don't understand it. Where the common problem is, it's somewhere with me but how. And idk. No idea. So I stay away from everyone because I'm scared to get close.
