Hi all. I would like to ask people, psychologists or just kind strangers. I am 16 years old and I have not been able to get out of depression for two years, I constantly have mood swings, (in other words, I wear masks), problems in the family due to the fact that my mother constantly works and she is never at home, I am looked after, because of my hobbies that helped me forget about all this, I often quarreled with my mother (and no, do not think that it was alcohol, I just love scooters very much and often spent time with my scooter stupidly sitting in the garage and fixing it) at school I have almost no friends, because because of bitter experience I am just afraid to make friends with anyone, looking for motherly love in other girls, I often had my heart broken. And because of this, the thirst for life simply disappeared. I just don't know what to do, I just can't understand why I need this. Thanks to everyone who supports me or just writes something, I will be grateful for any advice.
