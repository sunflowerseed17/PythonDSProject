So my 7 month old puppy has her spay surgery a few days ago. Today she has been acting normally and took her pain med in the morning. She ate and drank like normal, played a bit, and was her usual self other than the fact that she’s still on restricted movement. 

I had to leave for a few hours for work and she was sleeping when I left so I figured since her nap time was supposed to last 2 hours anyways it would be ok as she hasn’t been doing too terribly. 

She was in a crate with a toy and a small bit of food and water. I came home and she had pooped in her crate. It was solid like normal. She also pooped in the morning. But the thing is I ran to the store to get wipes to clean her up and make sure she didn’t have any poop on her since she can’t have a bath and when I got back she had puked. It looks like she had puked a walked to get away from it while still puking. It was really watery and brown. I thought it was diarrhea at first until I saw the undigested food. It smelled very strong too. I looked online and it said a possible blockage or it could just be indigestion or nausea. 

Would I be crazy for taking her to a vet as soon as one opens?? The toy in her crate was not missing any bits or pieces so I know she hadn’t eaten that and she can’t reach anything through her crate. She has been pretty well confined to that space or my bed when she isn’t outside since her spay. So she hasn’t eaten anything. Could this be due to her spay surgery?
