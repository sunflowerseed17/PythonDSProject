This tier 2 mechanic talent says that it upgrades the sub’s modular repairs to level 1. Does this continue onto other subs if you switch? If I get it now with my first sub, is it automatically unlocked when I buy the next?

Also how does switching subs work in general (forgive me: I haven’t played much in a while)? I remember you can automatically move your items, but is there a way to transfer upgrades to another sub? If not, is there a way to sell upgrades/subs?
