I’m 20 yours old “in the prime of my life “ and I just want to die I’ve struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts since I was a kid

I’m a transgender woman there’s not much I can do to change this. 

I hate my body it feels like constant discomfort in my body i feel sick at the sight of my body since puberty Ive mutilated myself about 3 time since I was a kid was a kid I did irreversible 

I hate my body but I hate the fact I can’t have kids I’ll never be a mum I know it sounds insane but why can’t I have my own children I feel like I’ve been robbed and it hurts so bad I’ll never have a family 

Relationships are impossible when either treat me like shit and don’t want to be seen with me or they see me as a fetish 

Friends are impossible none of my friends understand my problems and think I’m making something out of nothing

I’m just so done my life isn’t going to improve it’s going to be the same I’m struggling to find any reason to wake up 

I’ve been a maladaptive daydreamer since I was a kid and these days my thoughts consist of me killing myself 

I just feel so hopeless even when I tried killing myself I’ve never felt this low 

All I want now is too sleep and not wake up 
Im so miserable every day I i wake up and I feel numb 

Sleep is like a drug for me it’s the only thing keeping me together rn 
I’ve tried getting help and talking but my family doesn’t care and they think im being dramatic 



I want to try and get real help I want to be okay idk where I can go
