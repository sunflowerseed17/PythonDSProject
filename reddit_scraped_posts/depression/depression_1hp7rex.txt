2D1N S3 was my introduction to Korean variety shows and I have been a fan of them since then. Wishing them all the best!

You can watch Kim junho proposal in the last week episode of *My Little Old Boy* and it was mentioned in the recent episode of *Hangout with you* that Yoo jae suk just will be the MC in jongmin wedding and that more details will be released later (they talk about this in the opening talk only).

So happy for them :D
