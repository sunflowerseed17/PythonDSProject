I'm miserable. I hate my work. I hate the corporate culture as a whole. The constant grind in tech is making me miserable. It pays great but always being on edge for layoffs and constantly having to deal with an ever competitive job market. I left my previous job for a better environment but i just feel worse at my new job. I feel exhausted and spent. Im been contemplating kms far more frequently since thats better than being homeless in my country. What would you do in my place. I just want to live man. I dont wanna get super rich or anything
