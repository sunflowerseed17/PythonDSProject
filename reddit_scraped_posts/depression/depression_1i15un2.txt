I (13f) hate my life. I sit around all drawing going on the internet or just sleeping,I reccently applied for art school and didnt have much energy to work on my portfolio.I keep trying to change to be productive, but I always have extreme fatigue,even walking a few steps makes me wanna die,My period lasted two weeks in winter break and just started again a week ago,and my spine hurts all the time .Going to school does'nt help people barley even know i exist and i only have like 6 friends,I cant even count the amount of times I was forgotten on attendance and i skip a lot. My mom keeps telling me she dealt with it 2 times before (my sister)(my sperm donor(who is a piece of shit and isnt in our lives anymore)I just had another mental breakdown and said that i wanted to kill myself so my mom imitaded me and started yelling DO IT IL KILL MYSELF TOO! and she does'nt wanna deal with it anymore and guilt trips me or just tells me to be happy and i always got mediocre grades and my portfolio looks mediocre even drawing, something i used to love to do is tiring.I just hate it. Im thinking of suicide to make everyones life easier.This is my last resort.What do I do?
