Any time I try to post a photo that’s more than maybe 3 months old, this is all it tells me and I can’t go any further. The pictures were all taken on my iphone camera so I don’t really think it’s an issue with the file, I turned off and on my phone/closed the app and reopened already, I am connected to the internet, I closed any other apps I had open…all I can think of is deleting and reinstalling the app at this point? I’ve had this issue for a few days now and I really can’t think of what else I can do at this point. Has anyone else had this issue?
