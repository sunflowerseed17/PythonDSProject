First two photos are of the bowl I had tonight, the last pic is from a different day but it’s the same exact order and less blurry so I figured I’d show that for an extra reference.

-white rice (2 scoops)
-bulgogi chicken
-edamame
-cucumber
-carrot
-scallion
-orange slices (mandarin?)
-corn
-egg
-sesame dressing + sriracha aioli 

Calorie estimating app says 550 but I was thinking more like 800?
