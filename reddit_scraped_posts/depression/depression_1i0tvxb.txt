I've got one really good friend who constantly wants to hand out every day. But even just being on the phone is so draining to me...I don't know where else to ask this but even just talking to other people isn't something that makes me happy. I may smile or "be happy" in the moment, but nine times out of ten I'm right back to how bad I was feeling immediately after. I dunno...I just feel bad cause he always wants to hang out and I always say no, but it's just a lot...
