No negative feelings atm. I just want to be freed. Life is so meaningful but also so meaningless. Why should I spend years in this life just to die in the end? Why learn stuff, why develop myself, why get a job? Want to fly, feel the air, feel the freedomâ€¦ (I am sober, just wanted to express this feeling)
