I believe that I am the epitome of failure, I think it's in my destiny to be one

Just like there are born winners there are some born losers as well and I believe that I am definitely one of them

I think God created me just to show this entire world what a dumbass useless worthless loser looks like

I am in my mid 20s, I am unemployed, I have no interest in studying or learning anything, I failed in college and had to drop out, I have no functional use towards anyone or anybody

I am just a burden on my Parents and on everyone around me, I often feel like I shouldn't have been born

I think my Parents and everyone around would have been better off if I hadn't been born, there's no use of someone like me in this world
