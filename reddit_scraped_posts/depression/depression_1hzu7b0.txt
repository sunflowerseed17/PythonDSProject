I do understand that y'all want to gatekeep subs and I recently made a post about someone messaging me to literally order me that I should not post about subs and if I want to I should make another Id.

And how is that right? 
Why are y'all posting in this sub then. 
Why does this sub exist in the first place.

Y'all said she is being respectful. Well you can look at the image I put below to see how respectful she is 

As far as I understand the whole sub exist to inform people about sub.
I don't know, atleast I used to think of this community as something that people can refer to learn about subs.

Also for context I also mentioned this in my last post that I never told anyone about subs irl and in online as well.
And I do agree with the idea of gatekeeping subs as well but this is a bit too much to tell someone to not post about subs and if I want to I should make another profile.
