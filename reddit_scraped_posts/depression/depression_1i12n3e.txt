Idk, I just feel like out of all of the years, 2025 is the most rollercoaster ride ever and it barley even started.


I always have these gigantic.. like, mood swings I guess?


On one day, I'm so happy, ecstatic! I feel like the top of the world, I feel like I won, I feel like I achieved, and I'm so so proud of the progress and accomplishments I have made that got me to this point.


And then the next day.. it feels like the world actively hates me. Bad thing after bad thing after bad thing. Feels like my life collapsing, i failed.. I let everyone down.. that everyone is mad and angry at me because I did not meet there expectations.. I'm a waste of time.. and I do not deserve the gifts I have today in which I was supposed to feel grateful for


And then the next day might be happy again.. why does this happen?
