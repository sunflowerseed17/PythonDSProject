i’m 20F, i have severe BPD, Bipolar, and CPTSD, i feel like my entire life has been a curse and i was put here for the wit of other peoples amusement and to go through misfortune, i got bullied since i was 5 years old and went through an extreme amount of trauma that just happened again and again and again since i was a child, i’ve been SA’d and R*ped multiple times, been in countless abusive relationships and now i’m stuck in a domestic abusive household and getting abused by a family member, and lost all the rest of my family because i was being abused and they don’t care, just blame me for it. i just feel like it’s all meant to happen to me and i deserve this all because why else would someone go through this since they were learning to speak. My BPD and CPTSD is too severe to live a normal day to day life, i can’t afford therapy and i can’t get a job because i’m genuinely too mentally unstable for one, i’m so incredibly exhausted and tired and i feel like i’m at an age where it’s too late for me, can someone please tell me what’s the easiest and most high success rate of just actually ending my life? i don’t want to hear “it’ll get better” “you can do this” “go to therapy” because it won’t and i can’t. i’ve been to countless psychologists and been on multiple medication nothing helps. i’m tired of trying, my body is covered in scars inside and out and i’ve had multiple failed attempts and i just genuinely want this all to end, i’m so tired of having to live this life day to day and it all to repeat itself, i go to sleep, have nightmares constantly about my trauma and everything that has happened to me, wake up, deal with shit from everyone everyday and the cycle repeats, i’m tired i’m exhausted, i don’t even feel human anymore i feel like a walking carcass and shell of a human, and like i’m being dragged through life without my will, please what is the easiest way to end this? i’m so terrified of what comes after and where i’ll go but whatever it is will be better than what my life is now. i just want this to end i’m so incredibly exhausted.
