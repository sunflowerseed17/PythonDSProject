I am not good at anything, I suck at everything even at such a simple thing as driving a car, I have tried multiple times but I just can't do it

I have failed in multiple colleges, I hate learning and I have no interest in anything either, I have no job, no resume, no skills, no degree, I am just a burden on this society and on my Parents

Why am I like this? I wish I could have been different, I wish I could have been like others, I wish I could have been anything else but me!

I feel like God created me just to show the entire world what an utter failure looks like

I think of myself as a defective piece, a born loser who has no interest in anything and failed at everything he tried that is even remotely basic things

I really really wish that I shouldn't have been born, I hate myself and my life, There's nothing good about me
