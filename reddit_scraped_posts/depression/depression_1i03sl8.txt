really have nothing else to say other than i don’t wanna leave my bed and have been taking my medication back to back to sleep life away rn, college classes start tomorrow and i am motivated for them but have shut all my friends out like i don’t have the patience for my friends rn, every little thing is pissing me off. i feel so alone..
