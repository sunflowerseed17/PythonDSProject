I got my daith done back in September or October? (I'm kinda terrible with dates...) While I admit I'm not the greatest at remembering to clean it with saline solution I do clean it in the shower (at least once a day) with warm water and non scented soap. Is it a cleaning problem? Is it the jewelry that's the problem?
