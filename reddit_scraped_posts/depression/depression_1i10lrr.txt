24 M here and the last few years have been hard. I lost my dad after which I couldn’t be strong. I just feel like I always cater to my family and not prioritise myself. Shortly after which my girlfriend broke up with me maybe because I was “emotionally draining”. Well I’d say it was reasonable for her to do so. Since then I’ve been using weed and cigarettes as my escape. Up until last yet I had developed an unhealthy attachment towards people, maybe because I was lonely and I felt like I should put people on pedestals so that maybe I can have a bond with them. And yeah I realised later that it’s unhealthy again. Thankfully I’m not financially affected as I was always good in academics and I have a high paying job. But then Im so afraid if I actually make a connection Il end up ruining it. However, in the past few months I’ve firmly taken steps to improve my life by joining the gym and quitting smoking. Oh god I just realised after being high for months together that this is hard. My life just sucks. I really don’t know how to go forward. I’m pretty sure I don’t want to smoke again as it affects my health, appetite and many other things. But I’m so unsure how to carry on.
