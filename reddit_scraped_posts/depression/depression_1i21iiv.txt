I slept in until 2pm and then went to my parents’ house to do laundry. Slept the whole day, and started driving home. I started to see the horrible future that’s waiting for me and started texting my Mom a goodbye. That made me start bawling so I called her and through my choking sobs and wails I managed to tell her where I was and what I was about to do. She came and stopped me.

I’m glad it didn’t happen last night but I’m afraid there will come a day where there won’t be anyone to save me. I’ll be so hysterical that I’ll actually do it, and hurt the ones I love most. I hate goodbyes. I don’t want to leave, my true authentic self is a good person. But this depression, anxiety, ocd, and adhd make it almost impossible to bear. I fear that I’ll get better and live happily for a while only to relapse and actually do it. I don’t want that, but I don’t want to keep living this life if this is how it’s going to be. I want to be normal so bad, and have a cookie-cutter life where there’s no real worries. I don’t want to have constant unstoppable existential dread.

Can anyone else relate?

Love to all of you.
