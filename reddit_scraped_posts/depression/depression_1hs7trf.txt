So I turned on my bluetooth speaker and then for some reason it paired to some random device. Then I heard like a British man talk about buisness shit or whatever. I impulsively asked "ello? Wat u doin inside my bloo toot speckeer?" In some wacky voice not realising that he can actually hear me too, and asked "hello? Who is this? Why are you calling me?" and just hanged up.


That jump scared me but I'm pretty sure the man was just as jump scared as I am
