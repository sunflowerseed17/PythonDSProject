I was thinking, with how things are going. As AI progresses, I could see a lot of physically undesirable men turning to date AI women. 

A future where AI girlfriends will become as common as video games. And only the tallest and best looking men will be able to date real women, as real womenâ€™s standards are through the roof and only getting higher. Even ugly fat women expect to be able to date a 6ft tall blonde good looking man.
