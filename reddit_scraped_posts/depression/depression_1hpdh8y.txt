16F M19 dating for about a month. 
i just found out my boyfriend has been cheating on me over the phone, telling another girl that we aren’t in a relationship and that we aren’t talking. he told her that she’s the most beautiful girl and he said he doesn’t know me. really want to be with him and don’t want to leave him. he’s telling me to leave and that he deserves it but i want to try and work it out with him. we just started out relationship so i don’t know if he will do this again (he probably will) and whenever the other girl texted me he tried to deny it but whenever i sent proof he admitted it. am i insane for wanting to be with him still? i feel pathetic and like i have no self worth for myself. i just feel pathetic and i want some advice to as if i should leave or if i should feel insane for wanting to stay?
