Where are the best tamales in Kern County. Please do not gate keep and share in the comments people!!!

Oh tamales, wrapped in husks so neat,
A treasure of flavors, a savory treat.
Soft masa cradling fillings divine,
Every bite a wonder, a moment to shine.

From smoky pork to cheese so creamy,
Or green chile dancing, spicy and dreamy.
Your scent fills the air, warm and bold,
A story of culture, a joy to behold.

Unwrapping your layers, a ritual I adore,
Each fold a promise of delights in store.
Steamed to perfection, you’re more than a meal,
A comfort, a joy, a love I can feel.

Oh tamales, my heart is your fan,
A marvel crafted by the hands of man.
Forever I’ll cherish your taste, your embrace,
For in every tamale, I find my happy place.
