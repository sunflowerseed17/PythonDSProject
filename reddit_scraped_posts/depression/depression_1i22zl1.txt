I am a single female from Pakistan in my 30s. I keep getting suicidal thoughts. I have a good 9-5 job, but the problem is that I live with my mom, who is a very toxic person. My brother, who got married 20 years ago, has not met us since then and has completely left us. Because of this, my mom constantly taunts me, saying that none of her children are good. She feels that since one child left her, everyone is taking her for granted. She always misses him and is not interested in talking about anything else except him.

One of my sisters is married, but she also avoids meeting my mom due to her toxic behavior. However, since she is our mom, we cannot leave her. My mom either talks about my brother or about how she is a brave woman for living without him. Whenever I try to talk to my sister on the phone or send her messages about my mental health, my mom starts shouting at me, accusing me of complaining about her. She then begins crying loudly, making it even harder to cope.

On top of this, I was in a relationship with a boy for 12 years, but after all this time, he is not ready to marry me. In the 11th year of our relationship, we had a physical relationship. Now, he says he canâ€™t marry me because he wants someone who is rich, has a strong family background, or holds foreign nationality.

My mom is not interested in arranging my marriage because she is always focused on her sorrow over my brother. I know I have sinned, and I constantly ask Allah for forgiveness. However, I feel like I have no one to talk to, and I am overwhelmed with these feelings. This is causing me to have suicidal thoughts.
