Any fellow EAs, particularly those still establishing themselves in a new company or C-Suite role, struggling with post-holiday/New Year ‘return-to-work’ anxiety? I’m finding myself uneasy about the noticeable divide in my relationship with my supporting exec compared to past roles. For the first time in my career, I embraced the encouraged holiday downtime and disconnected—but now I’m questioning if that was a mistake.

There was no communication at all—not even a simple ‘Happy Holidays’—and now, hours away from my return to work (while still WFH), I’m battling doubt about how to approach the day, the week, or even the year. While I know my worth and role, I can’t shake the feeling of dread. I regret not using the downtime to ‘get ahead’ or proactively check in, but I consciously chose to lean into the silence rather than send a ping—especially since my outreach in the past often went unacknowledged.

I recognize this spiral stems from two key issues:
	1.	The relationship with my exec lacks a solid foundation or clear opportunity to grow and strengthen.
	2.	I can’t help but wonder if my instincts are right and my exec may have doubts about the decision to hire me.

Has anyone else faced similar challenges, and how do you overcome the lingering uncertainty while navigating the return to work (new year/relationship reset)— ‘regime’ with an already weakened rapport?
