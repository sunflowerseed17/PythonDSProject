I decided to go and see my dad today and I decided to buy some Weed, I have smoked with my dad for many many years and the majority of my cannabis I smoke with him today I got something and at some point he thinks that he said to me that we would split it however I did not know this and I had already paid the full price for it at which point I said no we can not split it I did not agree to this which caused him great anger Which was quite annoying to me due to the fact that I smoke with him most days of the week and he does not seem to appreciate the fact that I come to see him when he has no cannabis to smoke and when he does not have cannabis smoke he is stressed beyond stressed which may have been the trigger to this situation however he did know that I would share what I had with him while I was with him and most nights he asks me for some and I oblige happily but today my simple refusal of a 50 50 split drove him over the edge seemingly He kicked me out at which time I went to a shop and got some food and other essentials I realised that I did not have my bank card with me and I went back to his house at which time he decided to tell me that I owed him 30 or I should give him the weed or well half of the weed. Which confused me because he had not put the money towards his half Which he seemingly just decided he would have. He was extremely aggressive at his door when I went to get My bank card and Just repeated Give me 30 Over and over again until he eventually got physical with me grabbing me by the neck at which point I Leaned into him with my electric wheelchair I know this sounds a bit shocking but he had been aggressive with my mother who had the same condition so realistically it's not any different from That really. Anyway when I moved to wheelchair toward so that he couldn't hit my face He grubbed my wrist and said that he would snap it and essentially did what he said he would do because honestly my wrist feels quite bad at the moment I do think that biggie smalls was correct and I should probably heat the words of Biggie smalls in the future. If there are any spelling mistakes I do apologise however I am using text to speech thank you.
