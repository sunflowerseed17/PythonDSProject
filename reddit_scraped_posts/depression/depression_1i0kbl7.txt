i started to live here in another country (italy) the plan was to get a job and evaluate what was posible to do here. since i was broke and jobless in my country .
after 1 year and a half, i got in contact with an old crush i had, she was single again, and we connected, i felt in love , but I had so much fear.
opened to her anyways, and , she was so excited about me and our connection that she was really hoping to travel and be with me.
time passed, and things got a bit hard, i didnt had a place for her to stay with me, she got into a crisis. 
i felt really bad becouse of how much she changed her behavior with me.
her mood towards us, was dry and cold.
anyways this came and went back and forth. 
now we are closer to deside what to do, i have a place, but she got distant again. 
is so hard, to even think what can I do, i cant put pressure on her to make a decision,  but I can't just let her go on her own and feel alone .
yet , i cant feel depressed and make her doubt even more about me and coming to a person who cant even handle this..
and well, all these times i think, why i have this deep struggles and pain killing feelings about love, why is so dificult to love someone and be loved back , why is so scary. 
im tired as fuck, and sometimes i have these mood changes so strong, i dont  understand how is it posible to handle all of this. sorry about this rant
