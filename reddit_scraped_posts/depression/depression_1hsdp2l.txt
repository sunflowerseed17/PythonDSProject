I know this might sound like a bit of a silly question but honestly I'm hardly ever happy nowadays, i find myself wishing I wasn't waking up more than ever, and it's just been years since I can say I was in a even remotely " normal" position in life, and it hardly ever seems like it's getting to that point. I can go on and on and on about why but nobody wants to read all that and I wouldn't either. So please, how do I "find happiness"

Also please tell me if I should have this under the " serious" flair idrk
