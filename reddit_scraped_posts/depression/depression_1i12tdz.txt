I’m supposed to graduate in June this summer, but I won’t due to failing many classes by not showing up and not doing any work. I only stayed in school because of my favorite teacher in mathematics, math is the only subject I been doing well in (cuz only thing I actually show up to). But when I am in class around other ppl that will graduate I just feel empty and a sad jealousy. I am never passive aggressive and generally a really kind person and introverted. But due to social anxiety I failed other courses expect math. I never really cared about graduating since I been struggling with depression and social anxiety, self harm since 13y, I am 19y now. I spent majority of my time durning my teenage years alone and isolated in my room. I never had friends, I never had anyone to hang out with or do regular things with. I dread summer cuz I won’t see my  fav teacher ever again but also cuz I know what awaits me, bedrotting whole summer with heighten anxiety. I always planned to kill myself by now. And it’s becoming more desirable as time pass now, I feel like this is the only way out of everything. I generally never had any desire to do anything positive for my life, when I do basic things for myself I feel disgusted by it like I am pretending to care for my life,I just wanna lay in bed all day and disappear.
