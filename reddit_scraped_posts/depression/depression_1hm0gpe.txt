I just bolted upright in bed in a cold sweat after dreaming about a child getting devoured by a giant elephant seal.

I'm not sure why this particular dream set me off so much, but I am fed up with having vivid,  bizarre, and grotesque nightmares every damn week.

In the last few years my teeth having rotted into black goop dozens of times, several packs of rabid wolves have chased me down, I have spent hours falling to my death, been naked in public on a regular basis, broken out in various forms of boils and body decay, had spiders and insects devour me from the inside out, and watched thousands of people cook themselves on a giant stove.

I don't know if I have an overactive imagination, guilty conscience, chronic sleep deprivation, or if I'm straight up cursed, but I need this to stop.
