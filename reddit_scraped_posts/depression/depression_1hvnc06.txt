I don't know if posting WIPS are allowed here, sorry for the messy sketches >-<
I'm making my fursona into a vtuber and I was just doing some concepts but I can't decide on an outfit. Both are based on things I wear irl but im not sure which looks best. The first one is supposed to be this cream colored sweater worn with a gold cherry necklace and a black skirt. Second is a brown turtleneck crop top under a cropped cream color cardigan with some jeans. If you have any suggestions on outfits or accessories, that's very much welcome!

Character is Thistle, she/They, bobcat

Art by me :3 

Also the sub won't let me post multiple images you you can find the second sketch in the comments!
