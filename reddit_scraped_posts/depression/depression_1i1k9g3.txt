Due to my fault mostly, I ruined the relationship with the love of my life. I then made horrible decisions (got a substance abuse disorder) and derailed my career. I don’t have money, I don’t have any achievements and most importantly I don’t have her in my life anymore due to my own insufficiencies. 

My life is a role-play videogame where I made the worst choices and have the worst ending. Unlike games, I can’t load from a previous save game and make different choices. 

I am stuck with the worst ending. This is why I want to end it all. It’s better to turn off the game than to live through this hell I created.
