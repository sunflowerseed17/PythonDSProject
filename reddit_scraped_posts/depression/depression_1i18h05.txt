one of the most painful parts of depression, for me, is watching myself lose the ability to pursue any of my interests. i am a university student with the opportunity to research something i'm truly passionate about- literally anything, if i were to just put in any amount of effort. i can still feel the fascination i have with learning, but its like i can see that life i would have slipping through my fingers every time i fail and miss another opportunity for the chance to stay in bed. i feel like im locked inside of myself, looking out at the things i know i care about but just can't feel anymore. i'm so scared that i'm going to miss my chance and ruin my life because i can't stand the thought of eyes on me day after day. how do you deal with the constant guilt and anxiety?
