So I have been depressed for several years now. I am on therapy and medication, but still i have some difficult times, where i feel like i can't live anymore.
I plan my suicide when i feel this way, and the only reason i haven't gone through with it is because i feel like i can't  do that to my mother. 
I have asthma, and i have been having a hard time with it, and 2 days ago i had an asthma attack. My   nails were blue, my lips numb, i could not breath.  I really felt like i was going to die while waiting to go to the hospital. And the thing is, i felt really scared. Am i really not ready to die? I figured that because i am depressed a lot of the time, and i plan my suicide so often, i would be glad that a disease would "do it for me". 
I don't know what to think of this, but it has been on my mind since that day...
