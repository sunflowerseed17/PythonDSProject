I know others have it worse than me and I know I post semi often, but sometimes I find it helps…even just a little. I am breaking down everyday thinking about my failures, I have one divorce under my belt and on the cusp of another one. I have slept in a separate room in my house for the last year. There’s been no more intimacy and it’s all dead. I do all the cooking, I do all the cleaning, laundry, etc I am stuck in my situation due to money and being so tied up in mortgage and house debt. My job some might consider great but it’s killing me mentally. Like everyone else I don’t make enough to survive. I’m in pain everyday and if I wasn’t so afraid of actually killing myself, I would do it. I just wish my body would give out and everything would just stop. I can’t do this anymore.
