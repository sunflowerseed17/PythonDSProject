Be brutally honest. 

Person 1: 

Thinks if their family does something wrong towards their partner, it is not their problem because it doesn't affect them directly. They will not intervene, will not say anything, and doesn't really want their partner to do anything either to avoid any conflict. Happy go lucky person and generally doesn't see the point in not just being happy all the time. Essentially, thinks it's best to let things go because no one is perfect and we all make mistakes. And if you get mad about things other people do that you don't have any control over anyway, you'll have no one left in your life. 

Person 2 :

Thinks their partner's silence is compliance and if their partner doesn't do or say anything they are essentially agreeing with their family's behaviour, and also letting their family know that it's okay to treat their partner that way. Wants their partner to "stand up" for them and tell their family to not "disrespect" their partner. Says it isn't "causing drama" to address issues and talk it out like "grown ups". Also believes that if partner is on their side, partner's family will take it more seriously and not see it as "drama"

Person 1 does not like drama and conflict and feels addressing issues will cause this and make their family mad, and it's unnecessary when it won't change anything anyway, family is who they are. Person 2 wants their partner to "side" with them and let the family know there will be boundaries if they don't stop with their behaviour, even if that means less visits with them, etc.

Opinions? Who is right? What is okay?
