Another morning mourning your absence. Tears fill my eyes instantly as I realize I’m still here. Here alone in this bed that you once kept warm for me. Here alone with these thoughts you once kept calm for me. Here alone with this hopeless future you once gave me hope for. Another night constantly interrupted by panic and grief. Another dream sequence disturbed by your loss. I’m losing myself piece by piece as each day passes. The man I once was fading into darkness. All that is left is a shell of my former self. Soon that will turn to dust as well. I can’t keep waking up. I wish for my final dream. I know you will be there. Please, just don’t hurt me this time when I see you. Just hold me like you used to while I drift away.
