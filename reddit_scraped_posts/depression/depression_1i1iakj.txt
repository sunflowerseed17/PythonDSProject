I’m completely broke. I can’t even get groceries today so I’ll be eating tomato soup again. Made an appointment to sell my plasma on Thursday. I literally make $74,000 USD annually pre tax, and I had to pull out the exactly amount I put in my savings this paycheck (paid 2 days ago) to cover HALF my rent. I still have to survive another week and a half with literally no money until my next pay check. I thought I was doing it all right: I put away my savings in a high yield saving account, I started investing in reliable stocks, and didn’t splurge a crazy amount this Christmas (enough to treat my loved ones well) and here I am, 25, and FUCKING BROKE. 

I didn’t think I would get here at this time in my life but alas.
