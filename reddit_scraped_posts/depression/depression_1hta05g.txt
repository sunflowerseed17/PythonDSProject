I 19M have a boyfriend 19M, we’ve been dating for 4 years now I love him a lot, the first 3 years were very bad I always yelled over the littlest of things our second year of our relationship I became more happy with life and myself I stopped yelling as much and became a better partner but I became more clingy it was overbearing at times I always wanted to text and sleep on the call with him, all the times he put up with me and my overthinking and the BPD he stayed with me even after all of that, my third year of dating I started to do more of what he loved to do so we both could be happy in life, I started looking at TikTok and YouTube videos to help me with my BPD and how to build a better relationship I’ve gotten so much better with him even got happy with my own life I even made friends to give him his own time, he asked me to slow down at one point because of how much I changed as a person, it’s his time to heal from his past and also myself he told me once that he liked girls more then me at times but it never hit me but now I overthink and now that I look at it he’s been smoking a lot more even looking sad when we’re with friends he cried into my arms and told me how much he loves me and nothing would change but maybe I’m just overthinking and overeating about everything and need to calm myself down, time times a just cry for hours because I think I can’t make him happy, I have very bad anxiety to the point my heart hurts and can’t sleep one time I stayed up for 2 days on the 3rd I had to leave for the doctors. What can I do to be a better partner.
