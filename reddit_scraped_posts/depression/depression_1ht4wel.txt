I probably messed up the best romantic relationship I ever had. I gotten over people before but I don’t think I will get over her. It’s been a year and something. I am still miserable. I don’t have anything else going on in my life anyways. Imagining her living a happy life with someone else makes me sick. She deserves it though, she is a good person. I never found someone like her. I abused substances this year and destroyed my career. 

I am sober now, and on track to get my career back again. But all I can think about is her and nothing else. All the conversations we had and all the moments. 

I can’t take it anymore. I don’t know how long I will live in this rate. 

Just wanted to say something here. Thanks for reading. I hope you get out of this hell and become happy. I know I won’t.
