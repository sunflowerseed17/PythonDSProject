Prior to getting pregnant, I would always hear women talk about how prenatal vitamins do wonders for their hair and how their hair grew thicker, longer, etc. I was really looking forward to that once I started taking prenatals. 

I'm 34 weeks today and I honestly feel like my hair has stopped growing. I look at pictures of myself since my last haircut (which I got at 8+2), and I look in the mirror and my hair is the same exact length. It's been almost 6 months since my last haircut ðŸ˜­ 

What has your hair growth experience been during pregnancy?
