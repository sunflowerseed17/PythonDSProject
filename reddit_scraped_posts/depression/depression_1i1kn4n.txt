i really just can’t do it anymore. nobody understands i don’t have any friends expect one my parents would never understand- i feel like i constantly cannot do anything right. im running out of options and my medication isn’t helping anymore i have been depressed before but this is just a whole new level and i feel hopeless. nobody cares and nobody ever will im a lost cause who ruins everything. i’m starting to think it’s just best to go.
