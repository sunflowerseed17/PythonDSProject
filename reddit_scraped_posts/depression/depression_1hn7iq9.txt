My baby shower is a little over a week away and other than myself, only two people have purchased from my registry. I received some gifts during my gender reveal and for Christmas that I don't even want for my son.

I don’t mean to sound ungrateful, but I spent MONTHS meticulously researching and hand selecting what I want for my son. I chose a lot of clean and safe products. I’m very picky about what diapers I want, what baby products I want, what wipes I want, what baby carrier I want, etc. I want the best and safest products for my son. I don’t want to receive a bunch of stuff I don’t ever want to use on my baby. It’ll just be a waste and such a hassle to return.

If I knew this was going to happen, I would have just asked for all cash gifts.
