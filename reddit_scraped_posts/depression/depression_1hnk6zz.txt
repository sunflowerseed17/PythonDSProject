got hurt a few years ago, got dominant hand crushed and its useless, now i have horrible wrist pain in my good wrist, im stuck in workers comp nightmare, i quit drinking, tried 10 different medication, tried edibles, therapy, diet changes.  i absolutely hate my life, all they care about is just getting me back to work so they can settle my case, im going to struggle and be in unrelenting pain for the rest of my life, i cant get a decent job with no hands and i hate being alive every single moment of my life.  i enjoy nothing and i have kids so I'm trying to get through this for them.  i honestly cant believe that this is my actual real life.  i do not see myself here in 5 years, if i tell the psych dr they are just going to commit me to inpatient and i don't think thats going to help me either,  has anybody ever felt like this and gotten through it, im hanging on by a thread here and if i didnt have kids i would not still be here, im sitting here crying in the middle of the day typing this because i literally am trapped in a living hell and i dont see a future for me.
