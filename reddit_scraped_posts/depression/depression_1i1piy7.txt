Just donâ€™t know what to do, never have any energy or motivation. Suicidal thoughts at night. Lost my dad last year, been struggling with depression, social anxiety since I was 13/14 (now 29M), and OCD since 23.

Iâ€™m just so tired all the time, I feel weak physically. Nothing interests me half the time. Donâ€™t even know what to say or how to say it, too many thoughts. Iâ€™m not happy with how I am or my life is but I donâ€™t feel like I have it in me to change it half the time. My mood and thoughts are so erratic, I donâ€™t feel like a consistent human being. One minute I can have some hope I can change things and an hour later I donâ€™t anymore. Everything feels like a mountain to climb. ðŸ˜ž 

Not sure why Iâ€™m even posting, just need to vent somewhere I guess.
