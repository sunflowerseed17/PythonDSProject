Hello, this is my first time using Reddit, I’m not sure how this works. I’m 20 and like the title says, I feel like I need to die.

I always believed that I would die at 16, 18, 19- and here I am now, at 20. I didn’t think I would get this far. I always thought that one day I’ll get the courage to actually go through with ending my life, but I haven’t and now I’m stuck. I feel like I’ve been stuck for a long time now. Like, I don’t really want to die, I just want to get out of my situation. But right now, I really do feel like I have to die.

My sister who I don’t have a particularly strong connection or relationship with called me and told me that my mom and my grandma(who I’m currently staying with,) don’t want me. It was definitely the worst thing I could have ever heard in my life. I knew my mom and I didn’t have a strong relationship, but I didn’t know it was that strained. My mom hating me was definitely not on my 2025 bingo card.

My grandma never gave me any indication that she wanted me gone, but I don’t want to stay anyway. Even if what my sister said wasn’t true, I feel like I’ve overstayed my welcome.

The problem is that I don’t make enough money to rent an apartment, nor do I know anyone or even have friends to crash with and pay them rent. So, I’m screwed. I knew my time was going to come one day, but not now. I’ve written too much, I just needed to get this off my chest. My life isn’t all that interesting, but thanks to whoever is reading this.
