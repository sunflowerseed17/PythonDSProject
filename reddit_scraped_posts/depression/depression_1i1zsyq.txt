I have this overwhelming feeling inside me everyday, my mind runs thousand miles per minute and these days I can hardly control them 
They make me sad , stressed and ruining my day to day life
I was healing, just when I thought I got better, a huge wave hit me and now I'm unable to get back to my healing self , she's no more 
I don't feel her anywhere, she was confident and was able to control her emotions 
I miss her and i want her back
I want my mind to stop thinking, it's too much
Too much to bear 
Silence 
I need quiet 
I need peace of mind 
I'm sorry for my body for putting her through so much
I want to get better 
I want to be okay 
Rid me of this constant sadness 
Rid me of this unstable emotions 
Rid me of this uncontrollable mind
Help me 
Help me heal
