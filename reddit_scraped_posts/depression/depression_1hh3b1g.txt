When you live in a world that simply isn’t designed for you, of course everything will be so much harder. Add being an ugly short male on top of that, and you’re pretty much playing life on the hardest setting.  

I originally planned to delete my files from the game if my diagnosis came back positive. but I guess the hope of being able to improve my looks, and now qualifying for support with jobs and social skills made me reconsider, at the very least if I can’t have friends or a girlfriend then having a job finally after 2 years will be so beneficial, I’ve missed McDonald’s so much, and all the video games I could buy, plus new phone, new iPad, etc. And maybe eventually I could just pay for a girlfriend experience with an escort. 

Plus deleting my files is far too risky and not worth it unless I have nothing left to lose at all and the benefit outweighs the cons.
