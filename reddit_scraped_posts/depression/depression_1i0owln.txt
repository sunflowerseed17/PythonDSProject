As the title suggests. I missed applying makeup, doing my hair, picking my outfit and that kind of stuff. But I just can’t bring myself to do it.

There is nothing to look forward to or be excited about. Everything feels bland for me. I genuinely want old family gatherings to come back but I know that’s not happening.

As irrational as it sounds, I’m currently just waiting for life to be fixed. It sounds irrational because I’m fully aware that as long as I don’t make the effort to do something, it’s not happening.

It’s currently 12 AM at my place, but I genuinely don’t know what to do. I really want to have fun. I want to live. I want close friendships, deep conversations, and to enjoy life. But I can’t help but think how useless life and everything is, and how messed up it is.

I feel lost. Whenever I remember my old self, I just can’t help but wonder how did I have all of this energy? How was I able to enjoy life even with nothing in my hands? Why do I dread waking up and facing my day now? When I was so energized and upbeat before?

I need your help guys. Perhaps you can see angles that I haven’t seen.
