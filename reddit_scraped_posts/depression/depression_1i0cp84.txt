So...i was diagnosed with depression along with other things in 2024, and it was a difficult time of my life, but i went through it
So december was okay, i used to have some meltdowns but none of them resulted in a depressive episode until january 1th..
It was evening of january 1th and i was happy when all of a sudden i snapped and somehow lost ALL contact from reality and im still feeling this way...i cant feel emotions anymore, nothing makes sense anymore, i cried a lot on the first days but now i cant even cry, im just stuck in a limbo where i pretend to live and go on with life. I am on antidepressants but nothing seems to work
I miss my life. I miss everything. I miss my emotions.
