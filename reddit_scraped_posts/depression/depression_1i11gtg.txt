(Please excuse me, I am a professional yapper, pls skip to paragraph 5 if you don't like reading)

Last year back when I was a noob at PC components i bought an Asus GTX 760 gpu for a heckin deal of 15 dollars. Now not only did my lack of knowledge led me to buy an ancient gpu, it doesnt even work for my PC!

My PC is an HP office pc, it is a sff so the gpu wont fit the case, and it uses a stupid proprietary psu with no pcie cables so I cant even use the dam thing since my gpu needs an 8pin.


Well I have up my hope of using it, the cost of a riser cable and a new power supply is not worth it for the sheer age of the gpu, so for months it sat on a shelf collecting dust.


Fast forward to this year, my friend wants to get into pc building, with my better knowledge and understanding of pc building I helped him out in picking the components so he doesnt make the same mistakes I made. Now all he needs is a GPU, my 760 is a little old, but since I'm not using it anyway I thought of giving it away to him so he can use it temporarily until he saves up for a better gpu.


 He says he wants me to test it first as that will determine if he is buying a cpu with integrated graphics or not. But without a fully compatible PC in my possession I have no way to actually test it. If I remove the cpu cooler of my hp oem, it lights up and the fans move, however it does not boot since there is no 8pin cable (plus, booting without a cpu cooler is pretty dangerous anyway)


Is there anyway I can test if a gpu is working without its needed 8 pin cable? Or maybe I can wait for my friend's pc parts to arrive and we can try to test it without a cpu?
