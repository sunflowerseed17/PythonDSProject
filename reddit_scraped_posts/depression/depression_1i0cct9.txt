I grew up in a broken home. I was too young to understand why, but I remember sitting on the stairs, covering my ears to block out the fights between my parents. My dad cheated, and then my mumma-she ended her life in front of me when no one else was home. Just me and her. A year later, my dad remarried, and life with my stepmom was brutal. She hurt me in ways no child should be hurt.

Eventually, my older brother and I moved in with our grandmother. We lived with my uncles and their families, trying to find our place in the middle of it all. I did everything to be the "good child to make my dad proud, to fit in with everyone else. But I was the kid who went to every parent-teacher meeting, every festival, without parents.

Then, my world shattered again. My older brother my only real family, the one person who loved me without condition died in a car accident. After that, the warmth of my uncle's family faded, and I was left feeling more alone than ever. Depression, anxiety, insomnia‚Äùeach diagnosis weighed me down. I even tried ending my life once.

I've faced multiple relationship failures, and most of my friends from school have drifted away. Now, I stand at a crossroads, unsure of what's next, unsure of what to do with my life.

But through it all, I'm still here. Still surviving. And maybe that's enough for now.

Now I am that point where I am struggling financially to the point where I don't have anything and bills to pay.

I don't have anything to feed myself as well and no one to ask help from.

I sleep with hungry stomach almost everyday now but don't know what to do.
