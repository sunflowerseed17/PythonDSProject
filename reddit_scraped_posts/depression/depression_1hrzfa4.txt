My earliest memories are being afraid. I was not - as far as I remember - abused or mistreated (parents had a toxic marriage which has undoubtedly impacted me, but nothing was ‘done to me’) and I am now nearly 45 with fear still being my number one emotion, no contest.
I wake up every morning in a blind panic and I spend all my days terrified of… no idea what. I am a teacher and I prepare lessons, check them eight to ten times, even within other lessons I can’t stop myself from checking the next thing again and again. I have to look at my planning to check which room I go to next and cannot remember it even having just seen it. I feel utterly unprepared for every single thing 24/7. My brain seems shuttered. I see other teachers, I panic. See my principal, feel physically sick. Get emails on the school system, feels like punches to the gut. 
I was diagnosed as depressed 20 years ago, have medication - which may be tweaked in the coming few months - and my second ‘most popular emotion’ would seem to be anger.
And I am just very, very tired of being scared áll the time. I don’t get it.
