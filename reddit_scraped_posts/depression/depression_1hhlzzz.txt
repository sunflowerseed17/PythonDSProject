Sunburn sting, ice blocks glistening.
The beautiful sight.
Of barbies alight.
Strolling through a summer wonderland.


Pour the Sav, in the sunshine.
Serve the pav, up at lunchtime.
Pop the bubbles for Nan, Pineapples on ham.
Strolling through a summer wonderland.


In the arvo we can grab the wickets.
And plastic cricket bat your brother found.
Backyard full of all your distant rellies.
So we pass the can of mozzie spray around.


Later on, sun is falling.
And your drunk, uncle's snoring.
We'll hear the birds in the trees.
Feel the warm breeze.
Strolling through a summer wonderland.


Way down here, Christmas landmarks.
Are summer flowers, and funny tan marks.
We're happy and bright.
Not a snowman in sight.
Strolling through a summer,
Strolling through a summer,
Strolling through a summer wonderland!!
