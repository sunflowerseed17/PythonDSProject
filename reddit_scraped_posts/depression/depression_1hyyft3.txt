Ive numbed myself on porn, anime, manga and work for the last 10 yrs. Last year i had a relapse with my depression. 
For the past year ive just been feeling empty day in day out just going with the flow feeling no happiness or joy not enjoying anything fearing losing my job. 
I hate being born. I wish i had an off switch. 
There is nothing i wish for in life im just done and exhausted. If my country was at war I would enlist just to find a place to die. My motivation is gone and so has my will to live.
