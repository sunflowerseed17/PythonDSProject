I will preface this post by stating that I am... a project.  
As much as I hate to describe myself like that, I cannot see it any other way.

I consider myself to be incapable of love. All the same, I crave it more than anything. I know it is a very obvious paradox. The very act of craving it means that there is something more there.  
However, due to events from the past, I have... unsollicited barriers put up around my heart.  
It has taken me time to notice it, but now it is glaringly obvious.

I am surrounded by people who call me kind, hardworking, intelligent and handsome - all of them baffled by the fact that I am still alone.  
I cannot blame them for thinking this way, considering I am not at all keen to share what lays beneath all the walls I have subconsciously put up. Even if I wanted to share, I fear I could never get the words out.

I crave love, kindness and gentleness. I... want to love. I really do. So very desperately. I couldn't put this burden on someone who is unprepared for what I really am, but, by writing this post, only people who know what to expect will reach out to me - or at least, that is my hope.

...I don't want to be this kind of animal anymore.

If you think I am... "fixable", please DM me. Even if I cannot bring myself to love you, I promise I will do nothing but treat you with respect and kindness, for that is my nature.

  
Thank you for reading this far, assuming you did of course.  
I hope to hear from you.

With (hopefully one day) much love,

R.
