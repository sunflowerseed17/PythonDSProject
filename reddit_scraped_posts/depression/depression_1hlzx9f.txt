My son has Flipaclip Plus on an iPad (he got into the program when Premium was already history) and this iPad cracked. So he got my good-as-new Android, which had Flipaclip installed on it. Uses the same account, same payment as the Apple but it does not give access to Plus. It asks to pay. Now in itself I suppose I could do but it feels like a huge rip-off. Son has ASS so picking a new app is not - yet - an option. But paying twice is to me not an option. Same kid, same account so you should not have to pay double. 
Am I missing a trick here or is it really that simple: a cash-grab? 
Any input much appreciated! The other child plays with Lego, now that I understand.
