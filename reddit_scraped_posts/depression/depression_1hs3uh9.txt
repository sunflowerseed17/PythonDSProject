I 19 F, got drunk for the first time, twice in the past few days with my cousins. I wasn't like totally hammered but I still feel incredibly guilty. My father's side are heavy drinkers so I made sure to be careful as well. I've told myself that I wasn't going to drink until my mid 20s, maybe not even at all (even though 19 is the legal drinking age in my country), and I feel like I let myself down. Is feeling this much guilt after drinking common?
