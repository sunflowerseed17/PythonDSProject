ok so after three cycles of weekly taxol+carboplatin and keytruda every third week my tumor has basically melted away. nothing visible on MRI. I have one more cycle of the same shit, alright. but after that apparently I'll be poisoned for 4 more cycles with EC (if my outraged brain got that correctly). which is supposedly even worse. AND fucking keytruda. WHY????? I am sorry but WHY????? I am genuinely pissed, it seems excessive. rant over.
