I had a unilateral mastectomy last June. Just had an ultrasound and they found a 1cm mass in the remaining breast. I have a biopsy tomorrow. I'm in disbelief that I have to go thru this horrible cycle of worry and the unknown just 6 months later. I was supposed to be starting breast recon, not potentially losing another breast!
