One year ago today I had my first chemo treatment. I was so scared of what was to come. 

One year later I can say I never thought I would be where I am today. Iâ€™m getting my hair trimmed for the second time this weekend, my stamina and strength to do regular day to day things has returned. 

I still have expanders, but I honestly feel like I did before cancer most days. I think the things that helped me stay sane were a good psychiatrist and weekly therapy. 

It gets better. Hang in there. Be kind to yourself.
