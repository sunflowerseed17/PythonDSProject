I was diagnosed in April 2024 and began TCHP in May 2024. I did 6 rounds. After the TCHP ended I continued with Herceptin every three weeks working my surgery (DMX) in between those weeks. Radiation was not recommended for me. 

I am unsure how long the Herceptin will go for. For some reason I was thinking I would end the Herceptin about the time I started it the year before, as I would at that point have had a complete year of Herceptin. For those of you who have been through it, is that the way it works? 

I understand it’s best to ask my oncologist, but what is the “standard” length of time one has Herceptin or Herceptin/Perjeta?
