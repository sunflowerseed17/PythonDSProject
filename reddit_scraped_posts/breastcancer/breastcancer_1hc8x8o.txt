A few days ago, I confirmed the date to get a double mastectomy with immediate DIEP surgery. It’s IDC ++- grade 3 but small. Since it’s in the early stages, I could also do a lumpectomy with radiation instead. I opted for the bmx because I didn’t want the anxiety of 6mos of mammogram/mri, radiation, and fear of more cancer being found - currently only on one side. I also worried about how the lumpectomy and radiation would make the breast look. I wasn’t offered reconstruction with lumpectomy since I have small B sized breasts, and breast surgeon assured me a lumpectomy wouldn’t change it much. But who knows what radiation will do to it. Now I received and read the pre op instructions from the plastic surgeon, I’m just feeling overwhelmed and second guessing my decision. I was concerned with the recovery and never really considered the magnitude of the surgery. 

I’m seriously considering opting for the lumpectomy instead. BMX isn’t scheduled until January. Still waiting on the genetic testing, so maybe that’ll help. I was so sure on the BMX, but the surgery is scaring me too much.
