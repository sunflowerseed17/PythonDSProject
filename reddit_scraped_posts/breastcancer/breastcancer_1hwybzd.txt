I bought myself a 28MM Cartier Ballon Blue as a present for fighting breast cancer all of 2024, right after my 40th birthday! This is also my birthday present for turning 41 later this month, a day I wasnâ€™t sure Iâ€™d see when I was diagnosed last year. 

I am a bit bummed that 28MM does not come with automatic movement. Should I exchange for 33MM or does 28MM look good on my wrist? 

Thank you all! ðŸ’—
