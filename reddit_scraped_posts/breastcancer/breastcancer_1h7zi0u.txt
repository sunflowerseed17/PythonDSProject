Hi! TNBC, coming up on my second to last infusion (!!) which is AC at this point. I’ve lost almost all my eyelashes. But I’m having a new thing going on driving me insane. My eyelids are SO PUFFY. It’s worse in the morning but lasts all day. Anyone else experience this? I’m wondering if it’s just normal fluid retention or swelling. But also kind of want to go see an eye doctor to confirm. It doesn’t hurt but it doesn’t feel great. Thanks.
