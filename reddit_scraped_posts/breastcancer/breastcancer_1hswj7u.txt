I just got word from my medical team that I am officially NED as my first Signatera test from back in December came back negative. I am still undergoing Radiation treatments, and have completed 12/25 so far, but this result makes everything so much more bearable. I spent all of my 40th year fighting cancer, but now I can start 2025 knowing that I am healthy. This is such a great feeling.  I plan to celebrate with some vain shopping 🛍️ as well as a fancy dinner tonight. 🤪

Hang in there my friends! You will get through this soon 💗
