On the 14 of November, an ultrasound found a lump.  
Since then I've had a biopsy, PET scan, a D&C after suspicious polyps and spent nearly 10,000 on tests and visits.  
Diagnosis: Stage 2b triple positive breast cancer with a golf ball sized lump and 3 lymph nodes so deep in no doctor could find them by feeling them.  
Have had to switch hospitals multiple times after my work insurance changed its terms to pay first, claim later (with no guarantee I'd be reimbursed) and on Boxing Day I'm at my last chance, last resort government hospital after the teaching hospital I was at says it can't subsidise my herceptin.  
I feel so tired and defeated, and I haven't even started treatment yet. I know I can claw out some of my retirement funds for my treatment but pertuzumab is out of my reach because it costs 10,000 a cycle â€” money I don't have so I have to cross fingers and hope I won't need it.  
At least I have the whole of December off but I'm just so exhausted and overwhelmed by it all.  
It would be cheaper to jump off a bridge because part of me is so upset about spending so much money and the only thing keeping me alive is my parents are still around, and I can't bear to have them bury a child at their age.   
I'm just venting because I'm tired and frustrated. Though I've been lucky enough a couple of family members and old friends have helped me pay off most of the money I spent this month.   
Today I'm finally managing to do all the crying I've held back for weeks.  
I'm so tired.
