I have been thin my whole life. Always a size 0-2 until I had my daughter at 33 years old. It was so hard loosing the weight. I had my son right after I turned 26 and the weight melted off. I was miserable for the rest of my 30s because I tried everything to lose weight. Now at 43 I am back to my 120lbs and size 2. I’ve been so happy in my skin. After getting diagnosed, having a double mastectomy to expanders to now DIEP flap 3 weeks ago my oncologist wants to start me on tamoxifen in January for 10 years. I’ve heard stories about it causing weight gain. I know it’s a silly thing to worry about after having cancer but I can’t help it. Can anyone who has been on this share your side effects please? It’s giving me anxiety thinking about it.
