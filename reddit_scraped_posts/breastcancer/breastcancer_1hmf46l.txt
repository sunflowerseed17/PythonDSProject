For context, 41F, Stage 3A IDC, ER/PR+, HER2-. Started AC chemo Dec 3. 2nd infusion Dec 17. Next one NYE.
I started going to the gym after losing my dad to cancer in 2016 as a means to cope. Iâ€™ve strength trained on and off for 8 years. I took a break after my diagnosis but I want to get back into a workout routine now on the weeks I am feeling good. However, I have a PICC line in and the recommendation is not to lift +10 lbs. Has anyone exercised upper body with a PICC line in? Iâ€™m not planning on powerlifting but it would be nice to work up to 12/15 lbs bicep curls, and do something other than walk, but maybe that is not safe with the PICC in. Maybe it is just safer to focus on cardio for now until chemo is done? Would love to feel the mental improvement that comes with feeling strong during a time where I otherwise can feel pretty powerless. Iâ€™d love any feedback.ðŸ’•
