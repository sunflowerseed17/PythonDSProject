I had HR+/HER 2- IDC.  Finished chemo/radiation last year. I'm 18 months into Verzenio and endocrine therapy. My meds have been exactly the same since May. 

My last monthly blood draw, last Thursday, was weird. The nurses could not find a vein. I was well hydrated. I always drink copious amounts of water on the day before and the day of bloodwork because I know that I'm a hard stick. They ended up taking blood through my port, and the blood did not flow easily and was "thick" according to the nurse. They kept me until the CBC came back to make sure my platelets were okay. They were okay (lower than they've ever been, but still in range). I thought today to look at the results, and my AST and ALT are elevated. Four times higher than they were last month. 

No one has called me about the results, which I'm hoping means they aren't worried, but WTF? They have never been high before, always on the low-middle end, and I'm freaking out. I'm also a little miffed that no one called because I have one drink per night. I buy a six-pack of beer on Sunday and drink it throughout the week, which I told them about in my last appt because we were talking about switching my nausea med. It's even in my record. I would NOT have been drinking my almost nightly beer if I'd known that my freaking liver enzymes are elevated. Of course it's Friday afternoon so I likely won't get a call until Monday, at least. 

I just freaking hate this. Realistically, I know that I'm probably fine. But you all know what I'm worried about. I can't help it. This terror when something goes slightly wrong never goes away, does it? I'm just sitting here, working, decide to look at my labs because I hadn't yet, and bam. Terror.
