Hello everyone, I’m back lol. I’ve been doing well in terms of cancer markers still being good. However, recently I’ve been getting cramps or cramp like feelings, in my right chest side where I had the cancer/got radiation. It doesn’t happen all the time just sometimes when I’m sitting or laying down. I can’t recall if it’s happened while I’m standing or doing work (physical job).

Normally I can straighten up and it goes away but just now I couldn’t find a comfortable lay down/ lay back position and had to stand up on my knees on my bed for it to go away. I do stretch often since work does leave me a bit sore but I was wondering if anyone else has this happen to them? I will bring it up with all of my doctors the next time I see them. Thanks for any help!
