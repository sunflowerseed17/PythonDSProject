I finished treatment for Stage 1 IDC in December 2024. It was all quite straightforward. Lumpectomy. No node involvement. 5 days of whole breast rada and 5 days of boost. 

I had no issues with rads.  Skin was fine.  I was quite tired for a while afterwards and Iâ€™ve been on Tamoxifen since Jan 2024 and Iâ€™ve been fine with that too mostly. 

I had some cording immediately post survey which was easily dealt with through stretching and physiotherapy.  

Iâ€™ve had a tiny bit of stiffness across my chest but hardly a problem. But in the last week itâ€™s become a bit painful and sore. 

I have slacked off Pilates and swimming in the last 3 weeks dude to travel and getting a new dog. I know that wonâ€™t have helped, but does radiation start causing issues this late on? ðŸ˜©
