So my last chemo was going to be next Thursday. I’ve just tested positive for Covid and had it postponed for next week. The thing is: my daughter‘s birthday is on the 17th. My parents, who are in completely denial regarding my cancer, arrive on the same day. And her birthday party is on the 25th. I’m really pissed, thinking what I did wrong. I was really looking forward for it to be over... Does anyone have any advice?
