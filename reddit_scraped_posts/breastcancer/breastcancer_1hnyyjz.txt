Hey all, I’m a huge fan of the breed since I worked as a groomer and I never met a single Bichon I didn’t like. They seem to be incredibly gentle and well-rounded dogs. 

I am looking to rescue and Bichon is on the top of the list, I even found a 4 year old looking for a home. My question is, do any of you have one with small animals or birds? I have birds and I’m worried about the potential issues I could face bringing a dog in the mix. Do they tend to ignore smaller animals? Are they just couch potatoes at home? Separation anxiety issues when you’re at work? Are they quiet? My landlord is fine with a small dog as long as it’s not a huge barker. 

I’ve done a lot of research but it helps hearing from actual owners.
