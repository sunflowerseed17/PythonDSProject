Hiiii

I have two chocolates and we have had our second around two months now. Before we got puppy, our other dog was already picky about food. We have tried many different ways for her to eat and even changed her food. She likes it at first but gets bored. Sheâ€™s on hills large breed now. And for puppy sheâ€™s on hills puppy large breed sooo naturally our 2 year old wants the puppy food and constantly tries to eat her food. We either have to stand between them or separate them while eating their food. Or we feed our two year old at a different time ( like we out here food down, she doesnâ€™t want it we pick it up and when puppy is taking a nap leave it down for her)

Will this get better? I just worry sheâ€™s not eating enough anymore. Iâ€™ve already asked the vet and they said she will eat when sheâ€™s hungry but she has held out for 1-2 days and thatâ€™s more than one time in a week. 

Oh and sheâ€™s not sick sheâ€™s eating everything else literally in her path. Sheâ€™s a lab Hoover dog. I MEAN EVERYTHING lol, itâ€™s the nature of labs I know 

Anddddd she eats her food if I put a few doggy soft treats in it sometimes or sometimes she eats out the treats and leaves the food behind. The vet said to be careful with that because labs can get over weight fast. 

Any suggestions? I left a picture for cuteness. ðŸ˜Š
