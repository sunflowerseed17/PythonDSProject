So I have gone through what most say is the toughest time from diagnose to lumpectomy and now radiation. Am 14 rads in, two more and then 5 bursts. My armpit is fried from the lumpectomy , I have used everything and read on here about corn starch , been using it as my skin feels like it sticks together, so that was helpful. My breast burns and I swear I canâ€™t find anything to wear except for an old tshirt , that doesnâ€™t irritate me. Am scared of the next 7. I started hitting a wall of fatigue two days ago . Cought a nasty cold on top of it. Am so worried about the pills I will have to take , letrazole and its side effects. Donâ€™t know what the future holds and am having a ridiculously hard time staying positive and reading all of your stories I know I should be as it seems I wonâ€™t need chemo.so I feel guilty about not being grateful . ðŸ™ƒ am sorry about the rant  but sometimes I feel like I am going insane with the fear and the what ifâ€™s! If I could have some info about the pills I would appreciate it . Am almost 70 and had planned lots of new trips and I canâ€™t imagine whatâ€™s ahead of me .
