Hi everyone. Happy holidays. I was in a bit of denial phase (stages of grief, much?). First was devastated, then figuring out how to tell my kids, family, then holiday distractions. I need to start thinking about surgery options (mastectomy + reconstruction) stat. Apologies in advance if I'm all over the place here...

**Background**

* About a month ago I was diagnosed (again) with early triple positive breast cancer (I'm in my early 40s). I went for a regular screening mammogram and had the dreaded "can you stay and get an ultrasound" which led to a "let me get the radiologist" which led to a "we would like to do a biopsy right now" then MRI experience.
* Nine years ago I had a similar experience - found some tiny lumps - and had a lumpectomy (clear margins and nodes), chemo, radiation, Herceptin and Tamoxifen for 5 years.  Was told they got it. Celebrations all around.

The recent tests have identified that I have two new lesions in a new place in my breast (I can't even feel them) in the same breast as last time (leftie is trying to kill me). Surgeon said I can choose from single or double mastectomy with options for reconstruction. 

I'm leaning toward a double mastectomy with reconstruction (meeting with plastic surgeon tomorrow as she needs to assess my radiated boob area for skin changes. I was told I could do the mastectomy now and get reconstruction later. or get reconstruction at the same time.

**Questions**

* Why do people choose to get reconstruction later (after chemo etc?)?  (My initial thoughts would be to get everything done at once?) I was told that my choice to do mastectomy vs mastectomy + reconstruction would only be 2ish weeks difference in scheduling (as it requires 2 surgeons) 
* Is there a good list of questions to ask the reconstruction plastic surgeon? I don't even know where to start with this one
* I'm new to Reddit for cancer related matters.  Are there any good resources for HER2+ specific scenarios?
* Also what is the definition of a YOUNG cancer patient? (re: flair)

I feel like I probably have so many other questions but can't get it together.  

Thank you - I'm new here but already finding the community to be super comforting that there are people to ask questions and support each other. 

  
**Note**: I'm in Canada they are saying that surgery first, then my pathology and bits get assessed and then the Cancer Agency will determine what the adjuvant therapy is (chemo, herceptin other - apparently one area can only be radiated once?)
