Has anyone else been told by their radiation oncologist that they should keep their radiation tattoos in case they get cancer somewhere else like in their esophagus or lungs?

I had partial breast radiation, and he said that it’s important that nobody radiate that area again. I told him that if breast cancer comes back, I’m getting a double mastectomy. He said I should leave the tattoos on in case I get cancer somewhere else in the chest area. 

I literally cannot think of something more mentally unhealthy than keeping some tattoos on just in case I get cancer somewhere else!
