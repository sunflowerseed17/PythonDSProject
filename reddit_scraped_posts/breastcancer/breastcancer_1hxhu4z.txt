I went in for an ultrasound today, thinking it was for my ovarian cyst. Needless to say I was horrified when the Dr announced they were checking a liver lesion. Stage 4 thoughts immediately sprang to mind. Apparently it was all fine, nothing to worry about, and from what I could see it looked like a small cyst. I’m kind of glad I didn’t know in advance but omfg, I can do without that adrenaline burst.
