Hi! 30, female, non-smoker, in active treatment for triple negative breast cancer. I was in the hospital for a few days last week with a possible chest infection, but they told me that my chest X-ray was clear. I've received a letter now telling me to go in for a follow-up X-ray in a few weeks. I had to cancel because the appointment conflicts with my radiotherapy treatment (I just finished adjuvant chemotherapy) and was told to come in during walk-in hours instead. I was thinking of skipping that, but have suddenly become suspicious that they found something on my scan after I was discharged, or found something at the time that was irrelevant to an infection, and so neglected to tell me. I'm in the UK, no COVID, no pneumonia. I was vomiting blood, and was told I'd have an outpatient endoscopy, but they cancelled a CT while I was there to avoid unnecessary radiation. Are there any reasons other than a possible malignancy that a doctor would order a second CXR?
