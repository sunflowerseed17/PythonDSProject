Sorry for inundating everyone with so many questions. My surgery date is closing in and I’m a bit nervous. 

My surgeon said that during my lumpectomy, I will be having the internal radiation (brachytherapy). He hopes that will be sufficient, however he stressed “no promises.”

When will I know if that was/wasn’t sufficient?
