Hi all!! Iâ€™m hoping you can shed some light on timelines for me. 

Iâ€™m trying to work out my son coming in from another province on â€˜cancer care 2025â€™, and I canâ€™t seem to get answers! My surgeon said that Iâ€™ll have surgery Jan 28th, and then Iâ€™ll need a round of radiation, which made it sound like it was one after the other. But Iâ€™m reading that there will be a break between surgery and radiation. Is that consistently a thing? 

My son has his own life, which heâ€™s totally fine with putting on hold, but I donâ€™t want to bring him here for a few days of surgery and then be nothing going on for several weeks. Iâ€™d rather he came when the treatments start. 

Can one of you lovely ladies clarify for me, please? ðŸ˜Š
