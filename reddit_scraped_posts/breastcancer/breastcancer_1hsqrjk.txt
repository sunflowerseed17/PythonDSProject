I was out of town and just returned. I was planning a hike this morning but Ridge Road was closed on both ends, with police onsite.  I saw that they found a body in RCP, though it appears that post has been deleted from this sub, so not sure if there are any updates? Has the part been closed since then as part of that investigation? Or was this morning something new/unrelated?
