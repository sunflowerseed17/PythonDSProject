Looking for book recs related to:
1. State of healthcare in US in comparison to other countries / systems 
2. Grassroots organization
3. Revolutions? (near far past and present)
4. People successfully creating change in their country in spite of the government 
5. Oligarchies I guess? 

Idk help me understand why society is the way it is and what to do about it.
