Finished radiation 2 weeks ago. Been very lucky so far that I have avoided catching anything.
Had to get my blood drawn via port on Monday. They had me sitting with a needle in (sealed) in the lobby outside while they were processing next steps but it was cold. Since then, I just feel something like a cold coming on that I am trying to fight off.
Not sure when I was exposed. Last week I had to endure a ride with a smelly Uber/Lyft driver who started coughing at the end of my ride, Sunday-went to see the Leonardo exhibition which I could hear some coughing here and there, and then Monday. 
I donâ€™t have a fever but my throat feels a little funny. I have been gargling with Listerine and drinking lemon/ginger juices but I am wondering if I should take the antibiotics I was prescribed should I have a fever under 100deg and see if that will nip anything in the bud.
