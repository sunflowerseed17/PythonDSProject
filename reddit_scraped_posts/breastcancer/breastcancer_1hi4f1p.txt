I’m so fortunate that I am cancer free after 18 months of chemotherapy, surgery, radiation and more chemo. 
After so long of not feeling like brushing my hair or putting on makeup, I’ve discovered my old make up and method of applying does not work anymore. 
Is anyone else struggling to find products and application that feels and looks more appropriate today? 
I guess all the treatments have aged me quite a bit. It’s a bit depressing
