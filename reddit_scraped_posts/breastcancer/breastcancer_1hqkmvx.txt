I’ve been diagnosed with cancer and need to eliminate irritants to my system- namely, my smoking habit. 

Cannabis is pretty critical to managing my chronic pain and neuropathy, two things that will be made worse by cancer treatment. So I’m going edibles for now. 

But In curious about tinctures. Are they more expensive by dose due to the processing? What are the upsides and downsides? 

Anyone with cancer experience think a typical might help at any point? 

Thanks yall. I’ve really enjoyed the realistic, relaxed approach here.
