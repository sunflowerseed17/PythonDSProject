Not sure if that’s the right flair, but didn’t want to bum anyone out unexpectedly. To  be clear, I am NOT dying. 

I’ve been okay, but as I was doing the whole Christmas Eve thing with my family I had this nauseating rush of terror that I might not be around next Christmas. 

Those of you that are familiar with me likely know my prognosis is good, all things considered. But I’ve got my first medical oncologist appointment on New Year’s Eve, and the day prior I made a dermatologist appointment because I (think) I’ve seen changes in my moles and skin - I’m a pale redhead and have always had to stay on top of this, and my brain has convinced me it’s skin cancer. My stomach hurts, so all of the GI related cancers. I’ve been short of breath today, so lung cancer. My headaches. brain cancer. 

And so on and so forth. 

Usually my Xanax quiets this anxiety driven noise, but it’s not working. I just look at my husband and kid and picture this scene without me next year. 

I know it’s illogical, but the curve balls we get as BC patients won’t let me relax. Has anyone else dealt holiday driven hopelessness? 

I don’t know what to do or how to get through tomorrow.
