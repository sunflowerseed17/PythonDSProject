I don’t want to get too much into the past- in 2016 after having a preemie the year before I was diagnosed with TNBC. My husband lost his job while preemie was still in the hospital. I wanted to get a dmx but it would have taken me out of work for 6-8 weeks. I finish chemo, get a lumpectomy, and in April of 2023 I’m told I have no more likelihood of anyone else to get breast cancer again. Then in November 2023 I find a new lump on the other side. Also TNBC but now I also have a tumor in my right hip. I’ve been working full time this entire time while my husband has been working as a wedding DJ off and on. He did get a part time retail job when we bought a house. Now I’m not having a good response from chemo (IV or oral) and my tumor is growing. I’m bitter about him not having a job all that time and not being able to have had the dmx. But he doesn’t feel the need to step up and do more. I’ve had complications- sepsis, speed shock, intractable pain from Keytruda….. and I’m still working FT. 

We have two kids who still live with us. I need to make final arrangements, get things in order, you know? I’m leaving behind a nine year old, an 18 year old and a 25 year old. I just want things in place for them. But my husband…. He’s no real support for me at all. I can barely make it up our front steps most days and chemo leaves me in pain, swollen and bone tired. It wouldn’t phase me if he actually took care of the house I’m leaving him. But no. I’m afraid he won’t be able to cope, will lose our house and just be even more of a deadbeat. 

What can I do?
