In the middle of TC/Keytruda treatment.

Noticed that sometimes I have orange pee in the morning. Is this a normal?

I am thinking I am not drinking enough water, but checking if this is normal.

On nights that I am drinking lots of water (waking up in the middle of the night to pee), my pee is clear.
