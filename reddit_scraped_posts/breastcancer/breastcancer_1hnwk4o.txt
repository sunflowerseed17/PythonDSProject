I need some insight-  just wondering if anyone out there that had an SMX or DMX has had a recurrence in the residual tissue? And if so, how advanced was it before it was discovered? I was definitely worried about a reoccurrence with doing a lumpectomy since I'm +++, the first doctor I saw was a general surgeon and he was adamant on me getting a lumpectomy. He even called me personally to try to convince me to do it. I decided to go see a breast surgeon oncologist who scheduled the MRI, which found a larger mass and a 13 cm area of enhancement, which is probably DCIS. 2.5 cm vs 1.2 in ultrasound or 0.6 from Biopsy- Now Stage 2. So I basically have no choice but to do mastectomy (which I was leaning towards anyway, hence the breast surgeon consult). In any case, the general surgeon made it sound like, if I get a DMX and they leave glandular tissue behind, then if I get a reoccurrence, it's automatically going to be metastatic Stage 4... I guess I want to see if that's been the case with anyone out there? The oncologist says the risk of another breast cancer after DMX is super low...but what if?

Anyone have any ideas/experience with this?

ETA: not going back to the original general surgeon for any of this! Between saying an MRI wasn't necessary and pushing for the lumpectomy, He also talked a lot about $$ and insurance. Yhe original MO I saw, I really liked but he also didn't order the MRI- he did seem to favor DMX though.
