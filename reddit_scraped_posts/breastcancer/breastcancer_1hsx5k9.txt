I have triple positive node negative breast cancer (grade 3) but a minuscule 4mm tumour. I have been told I would gain about a 1-2% benefit from chemo. It seems like a lot of both short and long term pain and suffering for a very small reward in the long run. Like that very expensive extra insurance that you never need. Anybody else been in this position and chosen to forgo the chemo?
