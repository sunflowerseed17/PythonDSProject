ICYMI- I am 49 years old and have stage 1, grade 2, IDC (incorrect tag above), ER+ PR +, with no lymph involvement. My genome test showed that I have a mutation in my ATM gene which makes me susceptible to breast, pancreatic, and prostate (hehe) cancer. 

Three weeks ago I met with the first surgeon who had diagnosed my BC. He said my tumor measured .4x.4x.3* and all I would need is a lumpectomy, with internal radiation (possibly external too), and to take Tamoxifen for 5 years. It was at this time he told me that I could get the genome test. (It was strictly up to me.)

Today I met with a different surgeon. She said the tumor measured 1.7* and, after reading my genome result, she recommends a full double mastectomy. She also said afterwards, she will send it off to get the Ocnotype, then proceed from there (maybe chemo, maybe not). I will be on Tamoxifen for 5-10 years. 

I had hoped by getting a 2nd opinion that they would tell me the same thing. It ended up not being the case. Now I have no idea what to do. On one hand, a double mastectomy seems pretty radical, however, the lumpectomy seems like it’s not enough.  

Thanks for listening, you guys. As my husband and I were listening to the second doctor today, I was eager to get on Reddit to see what you all thought. I value your opinion, since most of you have been here before.

*The tumor size before biopsy was .4x.4x.3. After biopsy, the MRI showed an area larger measuring 1.7. Both doctors said that may be from needle-induced inflammation and tissue distortion, but the second doctor said that she goes by the larger measurements.
