Its my first time posting here, but I see how helpful all of you are to others, so I figured I’d give a post a shot. 

I am 35 (34 when diagnosed) and have stage 1A IDC +++ 1.7mm with some DCIS and focal LVI. No node involvement so I’m T1cN0M0. I had over 95% ER and 28% PR and Her2+3. Grade 3. I’ve had a lumpectomy, 12 weeks of weekly chemotherapy with Herceptin and Taxol. 16 whole breast radiation sessions, 4 boosted sessions and just started tamoxifen. I’ll finish immunotherapy (Herceptin) in July. 

1.) Does/will focal LVI have a large impact on my recurrence rate and prognosis if I had no lymph node involvement? My doctor didn’t seem very concerned about this at all. Does this mean it is likely to come back and metastasize or that it could be lurking in the body somewhere? This is all so vague to me. 

2.) Is it typical for +++ to be on tamoxifen or ovarian suppression and an AI? Both were considered for me, but the tumor board decided most of my benefit came from chemo and Herceptin. Does this sound right? I want to do everything I can to prevent recurrence. Should I push for the AI and suppression?

Any input is greatly appreciated. Thank you.
