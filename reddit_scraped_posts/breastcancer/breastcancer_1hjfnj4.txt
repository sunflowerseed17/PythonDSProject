Hello, everyone. Wearily, I raise my hand to introduce myself, 40f. I was just diagnosed yesterday with invasive ductal carcinoma with lymph node involvement. I don’t know hormone receptors yet. I know it’s the aggressive and angry type. 

This has been a roller coaster of emotions. Sometimes I am fine, sometimes I break down thinking about all the “what ifs”. I am a mom of three boys, ages 21, 16 and 7. I am so blessed to have an amazing support system, my husband of almost 20 years and my mom lives nearby. 

I requested anxiety medication and something to help me sleep at least through the next few days until I get in to see my future oncology team on the 30th. But being receiving the news Friday after 4pm, no one is available to get me a script until at the earliest, Monday. 

Please help me. Encouraging words, recommendations on how to cope until I know more. Recommendations on calming fears about a huge spread. Thank you so much in advance.
