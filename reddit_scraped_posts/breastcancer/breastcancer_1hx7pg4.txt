Hi all,
I am several years out of my mastectomy with immediate recon (implants under muscle). I am starting the new year with plans to lift weights but i have always avoided chest work due to my implants being under the pectorals. I am working out my back and shoulders and arms but skipping the chest workout.
Is that what you do?
I hate the feeling of my pecs contracting over the implant and dont want to risk displacing the implant by working out the chest. I see no point in toning the pectoral muscles?
My doctor seemed to suggest i wouldnâ€™t want to work out my chest.

I am curious what advice anyone else was given?
