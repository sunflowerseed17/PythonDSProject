Title: Really high Signatera result. Is it possible it's a false positive? Has that happened to anyone before?

Hi all! 

So my first Signatera test (April/May) was a positive of 5.08 and 2 lung nodules were found and were confirmed to be the breast cancer. After starting a new treatment the nodules shrunk by more than half and my Signatera test was negative (September). I had a Signatera test at the end of October that was positive of 3.78. My white blood cells were a little high that day and the nurse practitioner said it could be a false positive due to inflammation etc. And that the scan would give more info. I did another Signatera test 10 days ago, 5 weeks after the last one and it was positive of 307. The day I did the test, I had a bad cold and could not stop coughing. My white blood cells were like 21 and my neutrophils were like 16, so both were incredibly high. 

I feel like to go from 3.78 to 307 in 5 weeks is incredibly fast and seems like it has to be false. I have a PET scan scheduled for Monday, but I can't stop thinking about the Signatera results. Has anyone had a false positive Signatera test due to being sick or just a false positive in general?

Thank you!!!

EDIT: I am still in active treatment, so it seems odd that it would increase that much in a short period of time.
