Hi folks, I was wondering if anyone could help me understand some symptoms I'm having. I completed ultra-hypofractioned radiotherapy last Christmas, following a wide local excision in spring 2023. In the past few months my breast has developed a lot of thickness in the upper outer quadrant, and this has turned into areas of hard lumpiness in the tissue. The lumpy tissue is painful when touched and feels quite similar to when I had my original tumour, although in a different section of my breast.

I have just had a mammogram and ultrasound which confirms it is not a recurrence and all the hospital have told me is I have "islands of glandular tissue" and the "findings are very reassuring". But I don't know what these lumps are, and I need to know! My breast is swollen and painful and I don't want to live with this forever if it's something I can treat.

I do have lymphoedema in my breast and wondered if these symptoms are related to that. Maybe the tissue is going hard because the lymph isn't flowing? I wear compression and moisturise every day, but am wondering if it's not working? Or maybe it's radiation induced changes? But if so, why didn't they say it was that?

I'm being treated on the NHS so there's no real follow up care. I won't get to speak to a doctor at the hospital again. The next time I go will be for a surveillance mammogram in a years time. So am relying on the internet to help me work out what's going on and whether I can possibly treat it. Would like to know if anyone has had similar and if so, what you did about it.
