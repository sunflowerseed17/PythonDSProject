Hey everyone,

I was fully prepared to start bi-weekly AC on Thursday (1/9), but was informed last week that I'd actually be starting with 12 rounds of Taxol (the 4 rounds of AC will come after). 

I'm taking part in a trial where I may also recieve durvalumab, and apparently this is the order of treatment for trial participants. I don't know why I was never told this, but I suddenly feel unprepared.

Has anyone else done Taxol before AC? If so, could you please share your experiences.
