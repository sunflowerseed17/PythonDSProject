Ok just had my ultrasound (halfway check point) and they were having a hard time finding my tumor and marker. So they did a mammogram and THE TUMOR IS GONE!!!!!!! I do have the tinest bit of lymph node involvement though. They said a “normal” range stops at 3.0 and mine is 3.2. But great news!!!

Im so excited!!!!
