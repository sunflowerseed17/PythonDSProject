Hello everyone,

I had my last AC+immunotherapy infusion 1 week ago. I have Smx end of next month, then rads, and then I get to restart Keyturda and likely Xeloda or similar for 9 cycles give or take.

My MO said Xeloda is 2wks on 1 wk off. I haven't looked into side effects yet but what is hair growth like?

I literally have not bought shampoo in like 6months and have been using my husbands! I used to have very thick long hair, and I was going to reorder thinking it is more likely to grow back in the next 2 months? Or will it fall out some on the Xeloda?
