In May I was diagnosed with Triple Negative Cancer, a 2cm tumor, I started treatment with white chemo, immuno and finished with red, on January 2nd. Exams scheduled for the 10th, and then I schedule surgery. I'm tense, worried, because I still feel my breast throbbing where the nodule is located. Is it normal? But someone felt it during the chemo. I just know that I'm exhausted, I'm Brazilian, everyone here is enjoying the summer, vacations, and I'm going through so many challenges, low self-esteem, social pressure. I just want everything to end and I can go back to having a normal life, having dreams, projects, vitality, love!!!
