I felt like I was really doing good after my mastectomy and DIEP flap on 12/2, but I had to have a re excision on 12/18 and apparently picked up an infection from that and it's scaring me.  I went to see the plastic surgeon on 12/20, boob was a little red, got prescribed keflex and started taking it right away.  Then last night the red area was larger and the re excision site was dripping red and yellow fluid.  On my way to get it checked out now but feeling bad about it.  Anyone else have experience with this?

Update: apparently we (mostly my bf because I physically cannot actually see the spot directly under my reconstructed boob) are going to have to pack this thing with saline soaked gauze twice a day now.  The boyfriend is terrified of doing it wrong üòê
