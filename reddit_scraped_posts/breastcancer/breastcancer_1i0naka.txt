Hi everyone, 

I saw my oncologist on Friday to review my side effects on Letrozole and because of the hot flashes and night sweats she is putting me back on Tamoxifen.

I asked her if I have 3 years or 8 years left and she said because I had no residual cancer in my lymph nodes after chemo I only have 3 more years left on AIs. I didn’t realize that that was how it was determined.

Anyway, I will be transferred back to my PCP after my final two infusions of Zometa. She is also planning on referring me to a Wellness Beyond Cancer survivorship program (never heard of it).

In her recommendations for screening she notes that I should have only yearly mammograms going forward, as well as annual physicals and monthly self exams. No MRIs or ultrasounds every other year as I was initially told. This is because I am not at high risk for a new primary cancer (no genetics). Yet I have dense breasts which was supposed to be the reason for having the extra scans. She also notes that there is no clinical evidence to support use of tumor markers and that these tests should not be performed.

Just wondering if you kept one boob and are finished active care, what your post treatment screening program looks like - especially if you’re in Canada.

I gotta say, I’m kind of relieved at finally being set free, though it’s kind of scary too.

Thanks!
