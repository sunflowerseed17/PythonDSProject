My (29f) cancer was/is close to being tnbc (20% er +) grade 3. Was 2.2cm at initial scan and biopsy, but report shows as 3cm. I'm also brca1.

I had my last chemo about 4 weeks ago and waiting on surgery now on 10th Jan for double mascectomy and reconstruction. 

I'm more anxious than I've ever been now..I'm worrying about the long term, the fact its "aggressive". The stories of all the young women who never even managed to be cancer free and ended up being stage 4..

I want to see the end of this and put as much of it as I can, behind me. I want to work on myself and give myself a better life. But I'm so scared that I won't see the end. I've been hit with the shit stick with so many things in my life, and now I've been hit with the shittiest of them all, and I feel like I'm waiting for the ultimate shit stick to fall down on me and completely take me out.

I guess I'm just ranting, I don't like speaking about this side of it with friends and family as I like for them to just know I'm doing well, which I am so far, but my mind always runs to the what ifs.

Cancer is a shit stick.
