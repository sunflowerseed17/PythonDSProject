I was recently diagnosed with multi focal luminal breast cancer and am going to Sylvester Cancer Center (University of Miami) which has an excellent reputation. I had an initial consultation with a doctor who is a female (i did not realize this until meeting her since I only had a last name) She seemed very nice and answered all my questions but I feel a little weird having such an important surgery done by a woman and was wondering if I should get a second opinion from another hospital group. I love the rest of my team and they work together as a team so I wouldn't be able to switch out only the surgeon. Has anyone else had this situation and if so how did you handle it?
