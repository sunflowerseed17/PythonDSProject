I am about to start weekly treatment of Paclitaxel + trastuzumab for my triple positive node negative breast cancer. It's a choice I had whether or not to do chemo at all and I opted to do it just for that extra peace of mind. I'm looking for people's experiences with side effects, hair loss, ability to work, carry on with life normally. Any info is appreciated as I'm pretty anxious about this course of treatment.
