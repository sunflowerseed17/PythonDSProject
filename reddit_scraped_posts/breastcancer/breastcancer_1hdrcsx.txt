I 42F posted about a month ago about a possible spicular mass in the right boob after a routine mammogram.   Well I had the follow up mammogram and ultrasound today, finally.  Scheduling shit like this at the end of the year during snowbird season here in the tampa area is just plain hell.  Since the little spiky bastard was on my chest wall almost in the middle of my chest they didn't get the best view but saw the spicular shape.  Oh boy, we sure can see it now!  That was the most picture perfect spiked glowing bright mass I could have ever imagined!  Like it should have been in an oncology textbook.  Both the ultrasound and the mammogram tech told me without telling me that I need to start making a treatment plan.  I knew in my heart that it is cancer.  No one in my family going back a couple of generations escaped cancer, whether breast or pancreatic or other assorted types.  I guess now I wait and wait and wait to get a biopsy so I can wait some more.  As much as I love living in an area where medical care is top of the line, especially with cancer treatments (Moffit) I also hate having to deal with this shit here because we are so overcrowded especially with older people clogging up our systems (no offense to any older folks reading this).  I had to fight just to get this appt today on Friday the 13th which now makes me a little superstitious since this was  not the only garbage news today but that's probably for another sub.  Thanks for listening.
