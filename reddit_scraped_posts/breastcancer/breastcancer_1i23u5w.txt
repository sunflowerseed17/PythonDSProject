I am day 6 from my TCHP with Perjeta loading dose and the poo-jeta has been hitting me very hard the last couple of days.  It gets me up in the middle of the night several times, and I can't be away from the nearest bathroom at all times.  How long will this last? Please tell me that this won't continue like this.
