Has anyone else experienced this and how do I fix it or how did you fix it? Something I can try? 

I tend to roll on my arms while sleeping, I always have. But I wake up move and fine. Now after chemo if I do that it’s pins and needles, weird feeling, severe pain then pins and needles then I’m fine. When I said severe I mean I wake up in the middle of the night and yelp like a dog it hurts so bad. 

I do have neuropathy in my feet and from two different surgeries I have in both of my thighs parts that are numb from when they had me on the operating table. It was just pressing against nerve weird but it’s been taking a really long time like months to get it back to normal. It’s not as bad as it was. After my lumoectomy I’d get this burning pain in my thigh it hurt so bad, it got better with time and stretches. My arm pain at night is different though. 

Background: 

I’m stage 4  triple negative Breast Cancer. About to do radiation. I did 21 chemos, next week I’ll have my 22nd immunotherapy.
