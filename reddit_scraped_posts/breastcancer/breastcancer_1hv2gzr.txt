Basically feel like I’m waiting to find out if I’m going to die.  Had a bone scan last week and they saw something in my brain, so did a ct scan to find out if it’s metastatic.  I’ve already written about it.  Everyone has been so supportive.  The waiting for the news feels unreal.  Like the possibility I could be told I have terminal cancer is just seriously insane,  doesn’t feel like reality.  I should find out today. I am stage 1a so the doctor thinks the likelihood is low,  but I honestly don’t trust statistics and likelihoods anymore after being diagnosed.
