Hi all,

I just finished my last round of chemotherapy and am in that weird period between chemo and surgery. I don't have a date set yet (ugh), but probably will have my double mastectomy sometime mid-February. I have been VERY inactive during chemo, I was just kinda unwell and depressed so all I really did was go for short walks. As a result, I just don't have good stamina.

I was hoping to start to get into some gentle fitness so that I am not in the worst shape of my life by surgery, but I really don't know what I am doing. I can have access to a gym, but also kinda want to work out at home more because I am self-conscious about my bald head (I cannot wear a hat while working out, I get waaaay too hot even just standing).

Anyone been here and have some good resources or tips to share? Youtube, blogs, subtacks, whatever!
