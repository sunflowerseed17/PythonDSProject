Hi everyone,
   I'm over 6 weeks post DMX with expanders. (++-), feeling pretty great and enjoying this bit of normal time between recovery and next treatment steps.

    Pathology showed all my sentinel nodes were negative, good margins, all good news but there's this one odd bit. There was an intramammary lymph node involved in one of my tumors, and its not clear if it originated in the breast tissue or the node. I have seen my oncologist and discussed all the endocrine therapy options, but now waiting to see the radiation oncologist to get an opinion. My oncotype score was 4, and outside of this one thing I think it would be straightforward, tamoxifen. My surgeon seems to be leaning toward interpreting this as a coincidence, and the node not being the origin, but wanting to be cautious. Also there was some lymphovascular invasion, which the surgeon did not think would affect treatment, but the oncologist said it may be a consideration for which endocrine treatment would recommended.

   I'm curious if anyone else had a similar pathology and what treatment was advised. This group has been crucial for me in the last few months. I appreciate you all so much.
