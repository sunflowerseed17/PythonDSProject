If you are in a bad way like me - how are you going to get through this…I just want to shut it all out, and everyone …. I can’t though (2 elderly parents with dementia and 2 very concerned daughters on their 20s) I simply have to carry on… but every event from the Watch-night service, Christmas dinner,  and games night with family and Hogmanay  will just be me screaming inside …. I am also just dissolving into silent tears about 10 times a day and I can’t help it. 

Backstory - lobular cancer picked up on screening, ++- 43mm. Awaiting all the pathology on 3rd January from lumpectomy last week. Then the kicker- the dexa scan picked up areas of high density so nuclear bone scan and CT scan have confirmed this - spinal mets but I’m not sure how bad.
