Hi all. I keep hearing Claritin is helpful with the bone pain from Neulasta. How true is this? What has your experience been? I’m 2 chemo sessions in (Taxol & Carbo). Pretty freaked out at the bone pain I keep hearing about from Neulasta. Let me know your experience or what you did to counteract this?
