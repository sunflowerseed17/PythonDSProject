There's someone in my life (not someone I'm close to, but someone I care about) who told me they were recently diagnosed with BC. Them at 30, me and 29. We have different diagnoses but they'll be starting a similar treatment programme to mine. I'm entering the final stretch and they're just starting. I called them as soon as they told me and I'm afraid I talked too much about cancer. That was the point of the phone call, but they're so new to it, I don't want to overwhelm them. They seemed really chill about it, which is what I was like at the beginning, too. It sounds like they have a good support network, and probably don't need anything from me, but I told them I would love to be something useful for them. I suppose they know I'm there, and I'll check in. I hope I didn't scare them off. But if I did, that's okay too, as long as they get the support they want/need somewhere. 

All this to say, outside of the work we all do to calm each other down and keep each other informed here, does anyone have a story about paying it forward? Being a resource or comfort or safe place for the next person must be one of the few good things we get out of this or any trauma. I've always been interested in turning life into art - in metabolising experience through creativity. But I've had no desire to make anything out of cancer. Now it seems like this is what I want to make - I want to make it more bearable for someone else.
