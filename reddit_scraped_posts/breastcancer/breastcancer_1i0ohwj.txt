How do you stop spiraling and all the negative thoughts?  I can't seem to  turn my brain off.   I'm scared of chemo side effects and what it is doing to my body; I'm scared that the cancer is spreading; I am scared that I won't get through this and be normal again.  It is just too much.  I'm taking Ativan, do meditation, see a therapist.   Is there such thing as a cancer hotline?
