do some of you notice faster aging since being on OS and AI? 
I know theres no one fits all but since I read about lack of oestrogen makes a woman age faster because we need oestrogen for many different things working in our
body…
but it is visible? 
do you notice you ‚aged‘ faster on the outside since on these drugs?


dont get me wrong im
thankfull for my treatment plan and will do and take everything to lessen my risk for reccurrence but as someone whos only 40, who does botox and fillers regulary and was never satisfied with my looks anyway, im really scared of looking years older in a few months or years due to this drugs :( 
maybe this sounds dumb but thats just me….
