***updat in case anyone else is reqding this in feae like I was... it turned out it was a lot a lot of calcification. Which can be concerning, but due it being so soon feom radiation (just like the commenters said!) its normal to see. It'll just have to be looked at and measured***

I just finished chemo in June. Finished radiation in September. And am now taking letrozole and lupron. This is so terrifying.

I found out I had ++- stage 2 last December as well. I just want a break.

They didn't say they wanted a biopsy. Just wanted to redo the mammogram with a doctor present (I did my annual during the holidays so no doctors were around).

I'm so scared it's a reocurrance. I don't want to do this again. I love you guys but I just want to live my life already. I was finally starting to feel like myself again. Please. I just want to be a normal 30 year old. I want to get married to my wonderful fiancee and have children and just look back at this chapter in my life. I don't want a redo.

I had clean margins and no lymph node involvement after my lumpectomy in January. I don't understand. I did everything right. I just want  them to say that everything looks great! And that my mammogram looks healthy and that it was just scar tissue that they were worried about. That's it! You can go home and continue to take your meds and live your life!!

Please God. I just want to be normal again.
