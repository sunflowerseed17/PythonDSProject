Hi everyone. I was diagnosed with Triple negative breast cancer in Sept 2024, 1 day before my divorce got its finally Decree. I started chemo 2 days before the divorce finalized. The whole divorce situation was anxiety causing and caused a complete tear down and rebuild of my life. 

There are a lot of times I feel strong and able to push through everything. There are also a lot of times I feel like I'm on an emotional rollar coaster and can't stay on track. I have a call with my psychologist tomorrow morning and I'm trying to figure out how to broach the subject of possible depression. Something has to give. It is a yoyo of good sleep/bad sleep, eating/not eating, eating healthy/eating junk, etc. I just want some stability somewhere. 

Any suggestions on how to start that conversation?
