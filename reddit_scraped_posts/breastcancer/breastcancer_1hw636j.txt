Hi All,

I am 33 years old, going through treatment right now with two surgeries done, radiation starting next month and the next 5 years on tamoxifen.
Can someone guide me how difficult is egg freezing process before I start my journey on tamoxifen?

Is it recommended to get egg freezes or can I still have healthy eggs after few years of this medicine?
I am scared of more injections and more pain.

Thanks
