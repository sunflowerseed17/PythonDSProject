I know anger is not a good feeling to have. I try to be positive everyday. However, today I feel angry. Last year this time, I was in Brazil, was 35 pounds lighter, had my beautiful long hair and tons of energy. I was genuinely happy. This year, I have very low energy, having a high heart rate, pixie hair with tingling scalp, constant worry of when I gonna loose my hair, less or more nausea, done with first chemo and 3 more to go. Then, reconstruction and hormone blockers. I am pissed now. Fuck my life.
