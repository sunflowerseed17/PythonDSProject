So.... Here we are! I just got diagnosed with breast cancer two weeks ago. I don't fully understand what the doctors are telling me. I feel stupid or something! 

Everyone else around me is very upset, crying a lot, really worried. I'm not dying. I just have to have chemo for a long time from what the doctor said. Everyone around me seems to think I'll need to give up my job. I work from home, it's quite easy and I don't want to give it up! I need the money. I want to have children someday and my own home!! 

I'm 32 and tbh I just really don't know what to expect. Can someone tell me? Will I lose my hair?? Can I have children eventually, if so how long before I can? Can I work while I get treatment? What did you guys go through? 

I know this is a lot of questions but I don't think this is hitting me the same way as it is to everyone else around me.. I'm just trying to be positive and remain as normal as possible about this.. maybe I need to hear some hard truths or something! I don't feel naive as such. I just don't feel that scared or something. I believe I will get better and that I'm just gonna be ill for a while. Every now and then over the last two weeks I get scared for a few minutes and have a bit of a meltdown! Then I collect myself and I'm fine again but I always make sure to do this when I'm alone. I don't want others to worry about me. But... Should I be worried?
