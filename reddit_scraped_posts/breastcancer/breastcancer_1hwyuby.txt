I had surgery first, back in November. Finally met with my oncologist this week and she said that chemo is not indicated. So... I'm free! Good news, right?

Yes but... I can't help feeling like the other shoe is about to drop. My prognosis is really good, but I'm paranoid that I will get a recurrence soon and die. My husband and I were planning to try for a kid before I got my diagnosis. Now I'm hesitant because I worry that I won't be around.

I know it's irrational and that the odds are overwhelmingly in my favor. I had a ton of DCIS but only a few tiny dots of IDC. However those IDC spots had a ki-67 of 90% and were either --- or --+. (HER2 testing was indeterminate.) Recurrence is super unlikely based on the small tumor sizes, but if I did get a distant recurrence it doesn't seem like I could expect to live more than a couple years.

I'm trying to focus only on what I can control but these worries keep bubbling up. What do you do when you can't stop worrying about recurrence?
