I need to get this off my chest because it’s weighing on me heavily. My last chemo for TNBC is on Monday. Yes, I am soooo excited for chemo to end. But I am also beginning to experience a lot of anxiety about my prognosis. I will not know until post DMX in February if I achieved PCR. I am so so anxious about it. I feel like if I don’t get PCR my prognosis cannot be good. I am only 35 which seems so young to get a cancer diagnosis. 

I am trying to release this fear as I know I’ve done everything I can, and there is evidence chemo had worked as my tumor is no longer visible on imagining, but it was also in my lymph node which just seems… bad…

My oncologist has not discussed anything with me about what would happen if I don’t get PCR. I’m scared to know the statistics. 

Just venting. I wish I felt better right now as I come upon this huge milestone of finishing chemo.
