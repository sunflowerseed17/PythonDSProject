Hi everyone I have a question. Not sure how I should do it or if I need to tell my new job that I had cancer. (31F) I finished all my chemo treatments and radiation. My cancer was Her2+. So I‚Äôm taking an Anastrozole daily, Lupron shot once a month and have infusion of the Her2 meds once a month ending soon in April. Then I can get my final reconstruction and swap out my expander for the real implant. üíï

My last job basically let me go after being on FMLA leave when I was on long term disability for treatments, they reclaimed my job to re-list it but I‚Äôm still an ‚Äúemployee‚Äù just have to float around till I apply to full time position and get hired. I don‚Äôt plan on going back there though since I found a fully remote position and I‚Äôm supposed to start soon. 

I been thinking of switching to Lupron every three months but I‚Äôve seen some people talk about there cycle starting back or have severe joint pain. 

So I need help, it‚Äôs a contract to hire position I think 1-3 months before converting to full time. Do I share that I have some Dr appointments set that I need to follow up on or just use leave as needed?
