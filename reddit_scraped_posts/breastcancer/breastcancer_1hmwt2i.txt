TNBC
I was diagnosed in September with IDC, grade 3, TNBC, with necrosis. 3.1cm tumor and 2 lymph nodes involved. Started chemo and Keytruda in October. My weekly blood work showed declining RBC, WBC, hemoglobin, etc to the point of hemoglobin at 8.6 the beginning of December. My oncologist suspended my treatment until my numbers improve. So far blood work is the same and Monday will be my third week of treatment cancelled due to weakness in blood work. I asked about blood transfusion but the oncologist is not leaning that way. Has anyone else experienced this? What do they do about treatment going forward? I have an oncology appointment Monday, just wanted to find out if others have been through this and what are options.
