Hi! I am desperately looking for tips, advice, positive stories to help me get through this. My sister has been battling triple negative inflammatory breast cancer for a year now. She has had it metastasize to her brain and Omentum. But that is not why I’m here. Last week she was hospitalized for pneumonitis. She has been on the highest oxygen for 4 days, antibiotics, high dose steroids, dilaudid etc and we haven’t seen improvement. Please if anyone or someone you know has experienced this I’d love to chat. This is most likely caused from her chemo meds or radiation she had about two months ago. 

Pray for her and please comment below.
