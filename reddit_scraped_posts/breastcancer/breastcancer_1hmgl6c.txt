Hi everyone. On Christmas Eve, I had a massive panic attack. I start chemo on Friday. I was putting a gift into a bag and all of a sudden I was sobbing hysterically, hyperventilating, and I had dropped to the floor crying into the comforter of my guest bedroom. I was hysterically crying to God not to let this be the last Christmas I spend with my family. 

It didn’t end there. On the way home from my Mom’s, I cried the whole way home. I got home and went into a spiral because I couldn’t find my Xanax to calm me down. 

To be clear, I don’t have a drug problem nor is this common for me. I have one lymph node involved, my mass is .7cm, and it has not spread. I have a ton of lymphocytes and Tils which I’m told it a very good thing. Yes, I have TNBC, but I’ve heard so many success stories. 

Why am I so scared? Why can’t I believe I will be a success story? Is it normal to panic like this? Is Chemo hell for everyone? 

I need some hope.
