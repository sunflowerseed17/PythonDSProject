 I went to the surgeon yesterday and she provided more details about my tumor in my left breast. It’s small and currently not in the lymph nodes but ki67 is 30%, so it’s growing fast. But she said it’s stage 1. I have a MRI scheduled for next week and they drew blood for genetics. I also have a condition called neurofibromatosis, which may complicate treatment. Based on all results, we will decide if we are going to do the mastectomy or lumpectomy. The NF does not respond well to hormone treatments so I am not sure what to do. 

Anyone else here with similar experience or with NF?
