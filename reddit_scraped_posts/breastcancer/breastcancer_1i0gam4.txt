Hi IDC ++- grade 2, stage I, DMX with tissue expanders 12/10. They filled them with 180 ml during the surgery and I’ve had 2 fills of 60 ml so they are currently 300 ml. But the left looks noticeably larger than the right. Prior to the DMX my natural boobs were asymmetrical with the left bigger than the right, but I didn’t expect there to be a visual size difference with the tissue expanders. When I brought this up to the PS I was told that I can’t expect perfect symmetry and that they won’t be twins but sisters. I guess I just don’t understand how the same amount of fill looks different. Anyone else experience this? Or anyone have an explanation for this? Will the implants looks different sizes too? I know in the  end, this is not the most important aspect of all this but it’s been on my mind and I have to understand. Thanks
