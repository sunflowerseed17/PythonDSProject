I have had my 2nd dose of chemotherapy. 3rd one on Friday. I have dcis and idc triple positive.

I'm struggling to see the end of this all, I'm getting myself so down reading about reoccurrence and just thinking that it's a ticking time bomb until it comes back. I'm 31 years old (30 at the time of diagnosis). 

If anyone has any positive stories or anything that helps ðŸ™‚
