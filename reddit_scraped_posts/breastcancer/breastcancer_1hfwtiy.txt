Hi all

I am meeting with my surgeon for a consultation on Wednesday. My last round of chemo is scheduled for this Friday. I know I will be getting a mastectomy, and I know 3 nodes still showed some evidence of disease. I have asked for lymphatic venous bypass, which will be done with the plastic surgeon at the same time.

Any thing I should be asking? I know they will not reconstruct right away because I need radiation and already am booked in February to see the radiologist. 

I am debating doing a DMX, I have no evidence of disease on my other side and my genetics were negative... but i don't want to do this again.... I also may want to try for a 2nd child if I am able- I am 38 and we would have waited until next year anyways before deciding to try. I am okay not nursing, and also okay with being one and done... 

I just don't know if I should do both? 

I thought as I got closer I would have been clearer with what I want... I am just not sure. Any of you opt for both, when genetics were negative?
