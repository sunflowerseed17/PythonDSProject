I start chemo Jan 3, keynote 522 protocol for early TNBC.

I'm scared. Right now I'm more scared of chemo than I am of the cancer. 

I'm scared of side effects and getting really sick from low immunity and I'm scared I won't be able to hack it and I'm scared I won't be me any more. I'm scared of long lasting things from the keytruda.

It just feels all very uncertain and out of control. I wish I could run away.

It's also terrifying to think that after all that it might not actually work.
