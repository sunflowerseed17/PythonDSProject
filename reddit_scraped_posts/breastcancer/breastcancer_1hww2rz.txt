Dear Sisters in Pink: I am mid-40's and diagnosed with IDC (likely) that is ++- and about 1 cm plus a small area of "ALH" (atypical cells/cyst) near the tumor that will also be removed. I have scheduled a lumpectomy but haven't had any actual treatment yet. Things like radiation and chemo will be determined down the road. 

My problem is that I am becoming a real jerk lately. I am so stressed about my cancer, and appointments, and my parents are sick themselves (almost 80) and I haven't even started treatment. I keep snapping at friends and even office staff when they really don't deserve it, including one friend who has been staying with me to help these past few weeks, but has the annoying habit of leaving bowls of cereal and things all over the kitchen instead of putting them in the sink. It's stupid, but it's just ONE MORE THING, and we had a huge fight last night. I don't know how to make it through breast cancer without alienating all my friends and becoming a complete jerk.
