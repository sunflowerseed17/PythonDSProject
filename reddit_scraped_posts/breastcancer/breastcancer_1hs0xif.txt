I’m still in the middle of active treatment, but I know once I’m on the other side I am going to want to connect in person regularly with other women who have been or are going through this whole BC ride. I’ve looked around online and asked at my cancer center and there is no in person support group. I live in western Washington, does anyone here know of a way I can find a group? I am also thinking of starting a book club/cancer support group for women 30-60. I’m 47 and would like to meet with women who may be in a similar time in life. 

I guess I’m asking- how did you find your support group?
