Dear Ladies, I was diagnosed in autumn 2024 with 1.1cm tumor (++-) in my right breast. After many scans and biopsies, I was all set for a lumpectomy with SLNB (sentinel lymph node biopsy) because my first surgeon said that's what she would recommend. But then I got a second opinion, and that surgeon said that lumpectomy w/ radiation or mastectomy would be equally good. I also have a small area of "ALH" (abnormal cells) near the tumor that would be removed as an excisional biopsy.

I am so confused now. For anyone in similar situation, how did you all decide?
