Howdy gang. I am TNBC and currently doing TC every week. I’ve only done 2 so far. I absolutely do the ice gloves and booties. Last night, my hands started with a burning sensation. My cancer center explained its neuropathy and called in Gabapentin. It’s helping but I don’t want to take additional medication. I will if I absolutely need to. 

Has anyone tried acupuncture? Or anything else to alleviate this ?
