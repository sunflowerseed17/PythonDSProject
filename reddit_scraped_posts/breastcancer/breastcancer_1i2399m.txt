Hi I was diagnosed with HER2 BC. I still need a MRI to complete staging, but everything so far is pointing to Stage 2. 

Surgeon said I could do a lumpectomy, with Chemo and Radiation, about 3 weeks after. My cancer is considered somewhat aggressive, which means it could come back. 

I have some friends who are telling me to just have a double mastectomy done with reconstructive surgery. They said that way, I donâ€™t have to worry about it coming back. 

Would any of you mind sharing what you decided and why? 

To me double mastectomy seems a bit extreme.
