Hey everyone: I am getting stressed because I have a lumpectomy with SLNB planned for later next week (January 10, 2025). I haven't received any instructions on what to eat (or not eat), medications to take (or not take), what recovery help will be needed, like a compression sleeve for recovery from the SLNB? Is all this information that I could get from the nurse at the surgeon's office or the hospital? Did you all get like a sheet or a phone call?

Thank you! And thank you to everyone who answered my questions last week about whether to have a SLNB with my lumpectomy. You guys are awesome!
