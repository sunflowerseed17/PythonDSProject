I have Invasive Lobular Carcinoma, grade 2, 6cm tumour, ER+, HER2- & includes a few nodes. 
I'm 42 and a single parent. My boys are 10 and 6. 
I'm current 2 rounds into 4 rounds of AC, which will be followed by 13 rounds of Paclitaxel, mastectomy, radiotherapy and hormone therapy. 

I'm usually able to stay fairly positive. And for the most part I am pretty pragmatic about my diagnosis.  
Today, I'm feeling a bit sorry for myself. Every couple of weeks I have a wave of grief for the life I don't have anymore / what my post-cancer life might look like. 

Today it's about how my body will never look the same again, and that a) I don't have someone to be by my side through this, and b) dating was already a $h!show - it's going to be 1000x harder now! 

(Previous waves of grief have centred around my kids/parenting, my work, etc)

I'm trying to focus on the parts of my life I am exceptionally grateful for. And dont get me wrong, i am so grateful for so much. But it's hard some days! 

How do I get over the grief of losing the active, fun, happy, fit, healthy person I was before? 
How do I become okay with the new life and body I have (& will have)? 
And tell me that you managed to date and find someone after BC???

Thanks xx
