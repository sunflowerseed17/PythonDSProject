So I thought my PS used Sientra implants. I am currently in expanders with 380cc’s, 5’3” and 120. I have since found out he uses Allergan Implants / I don’t know why I thought Sientra. I don’t know much about Allergan. I liked that Sientra had the gummy bear implants that seemed to hold shape better. I have rippling with my expanders. I may elect not to do fat grafting as I don’t have loads of fat, I am 69, almost always wear crew cut t shirts or sweaters and am tired of pain. 

Is there a “best” brand of implants? What do most people get?

I am looking for your thoughts on who makes the best implants and what I should be thinking about and asking my PS?
