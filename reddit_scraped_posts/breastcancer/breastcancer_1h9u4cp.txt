I had a lumpectomy on October 18th. The surgery site has healed, but there is a hard ridge along the incision site. I've been doing a bit of research, and it seems like it is a hypertrophic scar, or maybe a keloid. I have gotten keloids in my right ear before around a piercing. It is a problem because it is right under my breast, and I can't wear a bra because the scar starts hurting (I tried).    

I will see my surgeon at the end of January, and I'll email him tomorrow and ask him about it, but I wanted to ask y'all if you have any experience with this and I welcome any advice you can give me.  

Thanks.
