Hey all! I am done with 17/25 radiation sessions to my left breast. I just noticed a radiation tan line on a small portion of my right breast, closest to the left breast. Is this normal? I am freaking out that they havenâ€™t been positioning me properly and that I getting radiation to my right breast too?
