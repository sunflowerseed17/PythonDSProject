Hi everyone! I finished chemo and radiation, hallelujah! I just got put on tamoxifen 20mg. I've been on it for about a week now.  Besides being a little more emotional (crying over anything slightly sentimental), I've had several episodes of feeling lightheaded. Like,  I feel like my brain is trying to float out of my skull. I cut my dose in half and started taking it at night.  I guess it's a little better,  but I still have these sporadic episodes of feeling drunk. Anyone else? Can anyone tell me how long their tamoxifen side effects lasted? Thanks!!!
