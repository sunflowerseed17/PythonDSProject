Tomorrow, is my first chemo. It was supposed to be on Monday. However because of freezing eggs, I had to postpone it to Thursday. Although first it was frustrating to reschedule it all,, it was for the best. I got my wig today, I could, took care of some paper work and official stuff,  freeze eggs, and clean home to the acceptable level. If it was Monday, I would be behind of more than half of them. I spent as much time as I possibly could with my family. Friday is a big national celeberation day for us. This year, it was not like previous years and I did a very cozy small celeberation with my family 2 nights ahead. Sometimes things can not go as planned, but it still can work somehow. Tomorrow, will be also my first lupron shot. Say a hurtful goodbye to my premenopausal days for a while:(
I had a very high libido. That is finito too.
I do not know its allergy or cold. I sneeze, have runny and itchy nose. Not sire how would I feel tomorrow after cold cap, ice mits on hands and feet, drinking ice water, and putting ice eye mask.

Please wish me luck to tolerate it all, also to not have any alergic reaction to chemo. Now, I go to start on new health care: olive oil on skin,  latisse, nail oil, Brian Joseph gel, make a mouth rinse for tomorrow, a protein shake, put on clean bed sheet, fill water pitches with water, and crash.

I will respond to this and previous post on the next few days. As soon as I feel ok ( I still do not know what to expect). I read them all, but please accepy my apologize if I respond abit later. Love ya all
