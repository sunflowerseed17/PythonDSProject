Hello- I have been a frequent flyer these days :) I was diagnosed yesterday, IDC + SITU I'm still waiting on the hormone testing to come back. However on my paperwork it did say the invasive tumor was negative for Basal p63 but the SITU was positive for p63. Everything I read is that basal p63 is typically associated with TNBC? Would that be accurate for those who have that diagnosis? I am curious why the SITU would be positive for it but the mass negative.... I also saw that sometimes as the SITU grows it looses the basal positivity... .sorry if this is confusing but hopefully someone can relate or add value here? TIA!
