I'm currently finishing up my final Taxol treatment. I an set to continue getting the Phesgo injection (basically Herceptin) until I find out the results from surgery where I will either continue with Phesgo or switch to Kadcyla. This means continuing to go to the hosptial every 3 weeks for a year. Not ideal but doable. However I currently get the Zolodex injection to protect my ovaries from chemo. I get Zolodex every 4 weeks.

My question is: Will I continue to get Zolodex, going in every 4 weeks in addition to Phesgo coming in every 3 weeks. Which would mean sometimes coming in every week, or every other week? Thats a lot of hospital visits and I was just starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel but going in every few weeks for a year feels like a different type of difficult. Has anyone been in a similar situation?
