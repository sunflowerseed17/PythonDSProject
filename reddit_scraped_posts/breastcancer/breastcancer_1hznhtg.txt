I (30) was just diagnosed with stage 3, possibly stage 4 ductal metastatic (several lymph nodes) breast cancer last week and am looking for any/all support/guidance. I have a breast MRI, appointment with the surgeon, oncologist, and genetic specialist all this week and the anxiety has been a true challenge. My medical team has already began to mention a double mastectomy to me as so much of my left breast is affected, my right is fibrocystic and they believe I may be carrying genetic factors - I was lucky enough to be diagnosed at a specialized breast clinic. But the idea of not only going through chemo/ radiation but also losing both of my breasts is terrifying. Any insight or positive thoughts are welcome!
