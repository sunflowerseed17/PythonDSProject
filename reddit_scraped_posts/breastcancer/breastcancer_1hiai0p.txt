Will be getting treatment for Stage 2 breast cancer soon-ish (once I get through all my hospital/insurance/payment hurdles, sigh) so wanted something huggable once it starts. 

Looked at squishmallows but nothing appealed and then I saw this little dude online. It made me think of the MLK Jr quote:
