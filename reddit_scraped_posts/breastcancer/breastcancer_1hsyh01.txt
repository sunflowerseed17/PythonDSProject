I've completed 4 of 6 tchp and have the 5th one next week. My ejection fraction prior to starting was 65. Now it is down to 56 which is discouraging. Anyone else deal with this? And did it come back after completing treatment? I know herceptin can cause issues but I feel like all the drugs are contributing.
