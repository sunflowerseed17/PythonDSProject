About 5 years ago at menopause I started to develop those thick terminal hairs on my chin. (Other maternal relatives have them also) it got so bad my GP prescribed me Vaniqua cream which has been great. I use it twice a day and whilst I have some breakthroughs, it was entirely manageable. 

Since day 1 starting on Letrozole my facial hair has reduced dramatically and I probably donâ€™t need the cream now. This is contrary to what should happen with low estrogen because facial chin hair is driven more by androgens and so on Letrozole you are more likely to develop more facial hair. 

Any thoughts on this ?? Or anyone with similar experience and an explanation?
