I'm going to be taking part in a study where I may end up receiving immunotherapy. I'm extremely reluctant/hesitant because of potential side effects.

I already have Hashimoto's (a thyroid autoimmune disease) and Pernicious anemia (an autoimmune disease where my immune system attacks cells in my stomach, ultimately causing issues with b12 absorption). In addition to these, I have PCOS (not an autoimmune disease) which makes my body pretty shit at responding to insulin.

Does anyone know if having pre-existing autoimmune diseases or PCOS makes it more likely that I'll experience the rare side effects that can come along with immunotherapy? Namely, becoming diabetic.
