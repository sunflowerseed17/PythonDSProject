So I have been referred to another Dr.  They wanted another mammogram (just had one done 2 weeks ago).  Then more ultrasounds on both breasts (just done about 2 weeks ago).  Then I go in for the biopsy and was told I was getting 3!!  I only knew of the large  one on my left breast.  Apparently there was a smaller one on the left and one on the right they also wanted to check.  So I guess I should appreciate the extra tests?

Am I going to be in a significant amount of pain?  They had to press pretty hard to get the biopsy of the large lump.

I am hoping to have results by Monday or Tuesday.  At this point, I just want to know.
