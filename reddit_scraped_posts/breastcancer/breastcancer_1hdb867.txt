I had my first-ever chemotherapy infusion two days ago (TC 1st of 4) and as luck would have it I started spotting the day before but was so focused on everything else I didn't even think to mention it to the team at the hospital. 

For background I'm in my early 50s and at that phase of perimenopause where every period might be my last, and most of them are short and light, except when they are not.

I am now on Day 3 of chemo cycle and Day 4 of menstrual cycle (so weird to have two) and still trickling. Last night I felt the first pangs of nausea as well as some back spasms. I've been getting nausea with my periods for years (a fun treat thanks to peri) and have always had some back pain. I discussed with the nurse and the pharmacist how I might not be able to tell the difference between peri and chemo symptoms (fatigue, brain fog, GI issues including aforementioned nausea) but didn't think to ask about menstrual symptoms specifically.

Does it matter which is which? The nausea did feel a little different, more like seasickness and less like morning sickness. But a lower back spasm is a lower back spasm.  Am I overthinking? 

I staved off the queasy with a nausea lozenge and still haven't felt a need to crack into my Zofran yet (I have Compezine as well). I took two Advil for the back pain and fell asleep early, slept pretty well and woke up with neither nausea or back ache. I am bracing myself for more symptoms to come on soon.

I'm aware that chemo may push me the rest of the way into menopause and this simultaneous event may be a one-time thing in any case, but if anyone has any perspective or experience that would help me know what to expect I'd be grateful.
