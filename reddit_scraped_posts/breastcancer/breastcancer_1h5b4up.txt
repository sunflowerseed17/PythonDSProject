It's been 2.5 months after my last chemo and my hair started to grow back about 3 weeks ago. I have a patchy buzzcut now, but the bottom third of the back of my head has nothing growing. 

It's a clean line of where the new hair ends and just a bald strip about 1.5 inches high.

Did anyone experience permanent hair loss in some places with TC? Or maybe you experienced a stubborn patch/ late blooming section? 

I don't see my MO till January and I'm trying to figure out if it's just slow in that section, or if it's likely I won't get hair back.
