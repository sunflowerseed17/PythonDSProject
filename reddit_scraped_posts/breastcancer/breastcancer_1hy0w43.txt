I’ve been having shitty complications from the port since I got it — with arrthymia, extra surgery to adjust, infection, cellulitis, multiple ER visits, and hospitalizations. I have had enough of this device in my chest, which accounts for about 80% of everything that has sucked about my cancer experience to date. I want it out. I talked to IR about the possibility of getting the port removed while I’m under anesthesia for mastectomy, and they think this is possible. 

I know if I attain PCR, I’m due for trastuzumab and pertuzumab for another year - I’m thinking I could get the injectable version, Phesgo. But if no PCR, it would be 14 rounds of Kadcyla. 

Because of port infection, I already had to get one round of TCHP through a peripheral vein, and it kind of sucked. That was 2 cycles ago, and I still have a (permanent?) dark scald mark where the IV catheter emerged in the vein that sometimes still aches. It resembles a second degree burn. I suspect it‘s from the carboplatin, because that’s the only drug that fucking hurt. The nurses quickly reacted and slowed/diluted it, but that’s how it ended up, in any case. 

My question is: have any of you received Kadcyla through a peripheral vein? How did it go? Did you have any scald marks? Is the risk of infiltration rather serious like TC? 14 rounds is kind of a lot. But keeping this damn device in my chest is also kind of a lot.
