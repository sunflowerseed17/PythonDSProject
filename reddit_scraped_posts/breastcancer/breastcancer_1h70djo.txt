Hi Everyone! I was hoping to get some support and advice regarding my most recent breast ultrasound and mammogram. I had a mammogram & ultrasound 6 months ago due to some pain in my right breast and a lump. I was told it was a larger cluster of cysts, and that I also had a couple small cysts in my left breast. They said to come back for a follow up in 6 months if the cysts in my right breast were bothering me still and I could get them removed (aspirated) the hope was the cysts would get smaller on their own. I just had my follow up and they are concerned I have a mass and not cysts and scheduled a biopsy for this Friday. I’m pretty worried and upset how it went from you have benign cysts and now I may not? I’ve had a nasty cold the last week or so, and was told my lymph node looks abnormal on my right side as well. The doctor I chatted with who reviewed my images was pretty sterile and cold. She also communicated if it is more serious (cancer) that it could have spread to my lymph node. This totally had me spiralling and crying yesterday. I’m trying to remain calm but it’s been really fucking hard. My biopsy is scheduled for this Friday. It’s all I can think about honestly. Please share your experiences with me! All advice is welcome. Thank you so much!
