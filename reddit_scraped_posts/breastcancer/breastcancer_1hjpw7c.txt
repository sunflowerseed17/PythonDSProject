Iâ€™m a 49f who is 1.5 years post GB. Iâ€™ve just been diagnosed with breast cancer. Iâ€™m just wondering if anyone else has navigated this journey post bypass? Any problems with tolerating medications? Weight regain? Anything I can prep for or do to help? Iâ€™m in the beginning so am unsure of my treatment path at this time. Iâ€™m scared of this whole journey but it seems to suck even more because I finally am at a healthy weight. My new and better life was just beginning ðŸ˜¢. Sorry for the pity party and thanks for any insight if you have it.
