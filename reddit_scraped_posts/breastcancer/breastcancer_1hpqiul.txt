Hi everyone. I just turned 37, no previous history of health issues or cancer. I have a supportive husband and 2 young kids. 
Newly diagnosed with IDC grade 3, ++-
I donâ€™t have an exact stage yet as weâ€™re assuming IV until proven otherwise. 

I found a large lump (7cm) in my right breast in early November, had a mammogram 12/2â€¦core needle biopsy 12/3â€¦ confirmed to be cancer with lymph node metastasis 12/5. 
I then had a CT Bone scan which showed a large round spot in my skull and some sub centimeter lesions in my lumbar spine. 
I met with my care team (breast/plastic surgeons and radiologist) who I really like and am grateful to have access to. 
The meeting with my oncologist was a week laterâ€¦ also really like her and am confident in her expertise. She and I mostly discussed treatment for stage 4 (chemo) and briefly discussed what stage 3 treatment would look like (chemo, DMX and recon, then radiation) 

After meeting with the care team I had a breast MRI,  and a PET scan on 12/24â€”which I was under the impression would sort of be the defining scan to determine stage..  I read through the results myself (organs clear and no radiotracer avid lesions in bone) but have not heard from any of my doctors to discuss results. I know things are probably delayed due to the holidays. 

I also had an enlarged thyroid nodule flaggedâ€” had an ultrasound for that last Friday and it came back as TIRADS-2. 

I have a brain MRI scheduled today, a skull biopsy scheduled in 2 weeks on the 13thâ€¦ and then another meeting with my oncologist on January 27th. 


I guess my point to this long and rambling post is to express that while I am so grateful for the thoroughness of scans and biopsies and examinations, I am starting to feel very frustrated that everything feels so non-urgent, and I likely wonâ€™t even be starting treatment till February?? My grade 3 cancer isnâ€™t pausing its growth while we figure all this out and Iâ€™m worried that it is just continuing to spread while I am waiting. 
I know it has not been that long since initial diagnosis and Iâ€™m trying to just trust the process and my care team. 
I think Iâ€™ve done a good job of keeping myself together mentally through the holidays, being happy and present for my family and kids. BUTâ€¦ Iâ€™m starting to teeter in this limbo space of waiting to find out if I have a terminal diagnosis or a curable diagnosis hanging over my head and it doesnâ€™t feel great. 

If anyone here has had a similar experience or any reassuring words or advice I would really appreciate it ðŸ–¤
