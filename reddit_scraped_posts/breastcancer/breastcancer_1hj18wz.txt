Just got my biopsy diagnosis. Invasive ductal cancer. Estrogen positive, progesterone weakly positive, HER2 negative. Here comes a new journey and menopause. I’m scared. They say breast cancer doesn’t cause pain. Thank God mine is hurting or it may have delayed diagnosis as that is why I asked for a diagnostic mammogram especially after I noticed a nipple retraction. I hate to be here but am unsure of what is next.
