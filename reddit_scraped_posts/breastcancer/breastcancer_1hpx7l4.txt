My husbands company had a new insurance plan starting 1/1.  I had my mastectomy scheduled for 1/10.  I just found out my plastic surgeon doesnâ€™t take my new insurance (aetna).  They said if I still want to use them I will have to pay out of pocket and submit for reimbursement myself from Aetna.  Has anyone had an experience like this and had to pay out of pocket and get reimbursed?  

Long story short there was a miscommunication between my husband and I and I thought we were staying with the same insurance and just found out last week that we have a new provider.  

I am scared that this will delay my mastectomy on 1/10 because the breast surgeon needs to get a new pre authorization for the mastectomy portion of the surgery and the hospital services.  

Can they somehow expedite the pre approvals? Or will the new insurance company not give a rats ass and take their sweet time?
