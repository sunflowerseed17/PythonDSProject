I'm looking for some hope here. Has anyone that has finished their 2 years of Verzenio experienced hair thinning while on it, and then seen it start to come back after you were done?  I feel like I just got my hair back and now I'm losing it again! I am 16 months into my course, and since early fall I have been shedding like crazy and it's just not growing back. My onco thinks it's probably the Verzenio causing it because I'm only on baby tam. It's getting really thin up top to the point I am considering a topper (I'd rather avoid minoxidil because I know it's crazy toxic to cats and I need my emotional support snuggles!) Has anyone else gone through this?
