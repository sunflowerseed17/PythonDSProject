Hi everyone, just need to get this off my chest ( tee hee hee) I had my first mammogram since my lumpectomy (23/12/23) and ( 27/01/24) last week. I got a call a few days ago to say they wanted to do another mammogram but with a magnifier.

I went in yesterday and ended up having 2 biopsies as there are 2 new areas where calcifications are present. One is fairly close to where the lumpectomy was - I am hoping it may just be scar tissue.

I wonâ€™t get the results for about 3 weeks - my next appointment is the 27th January.

I was originally diagnosed with non-invasive DCIS - I donâ€™t know the likelihood of the cancer coming back or whether these are just â€˜harmlessâ€™ calcifications or possibly scar tissue ( I have keloids) I also had radiation but declined the Tamoxifen. 

I know Iâ€™m getting ahead of myself but if the cancer has come back and itâ€™s now in 2 places in my breast - would they suggest removing the breast or doing another lumpectomy?
 
Sorry I donâ€™t expect answers and I know I need to wait until the results come back but Iâ€™m feeling so anxious about it. I still feel like I havenâ€™t fully recovered from the radiation which finished (21/04/24). I just started some physio to help with the muscle fibrosis which has been quite painful and never mind the fatigue.

 Still I am grateful they are so pro-active at my local hospital and breast care centre. 

Thank you for reading ðŸ’•
