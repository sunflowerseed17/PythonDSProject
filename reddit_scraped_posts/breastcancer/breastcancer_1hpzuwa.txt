Hey so I finished chemotherapy treatments in April and in September my fertility doctor said my FSH levels were at a 50 which is considered perimenopause. She said it will not come back but I got my period on the 16th of this month! Does this mean that my body is back to normal from the chemo and Lupron I was given? I had one shot a month of Lupron. Iâ€™m so confused and lost because we already started the process with the fertility doctor with an egg donor and making embryos. Would love some feedback, very confused ðŸ’•
