Hello you lovely ladies! Merry Xmas! 

I am planning a lumpectomy in January to remove a small (1 cm) tumor of IDC in my right breast. Standard protocol is to do a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNLB) as well. My scans (mammograms and breast MRI) all came back with no lymph node involvement. 

I am thinking of declining the SNLB due to a weird injury situation I have: I injured my LEFT shoulder (not the breast cancer side) about 10 years ago (fell playing sports) and as a result, need to use my RIGHT arm for most major things (lifting groceries, etc.). Based on this, I am very nervous of any injury or lymphedema to my RIGHT arm/shoulder. I would be kind of permanently disabled. 

Do any of you have stats on benefits of a SNLB for stage one breast cancer with no known lymph node involvement and/or been in a similar situation? 

  
Happy holidays!
