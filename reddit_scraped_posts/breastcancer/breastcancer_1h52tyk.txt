Need some words of encouragement. This has been so fucking difficult. I'm not feeling supported by the people I thought I could count on right now. Makes me feel even more alone than before. 
Hoping they will finally do a dose reduction this time as I have done the full doses everytime. And (as expected), the side effects have gotten worse each time.
