Hi all! 

So my first Signatera test (April/May) was a positive of 5.08 and 2 lung nodules were found and were confirmed to be the TNBC. After starting Trodelvy the nodules shrunk by more than half and my Signatera test was negative (September). I had a Signatera test at the end of October that was positive of 3.78. My white blood cells were a little high that day and the nurse practitioner said it could be a false positive due to inflammation etc. And that the scan would give more info. I did another Signatera test 10 days ago, 5 weeks after the last one and it was positive of 307. The day I did the test, I had a bad cold and could not stop coughing. My white blood cells were like 21 and my neutrophils were like 16, so both were incredibly high. 

I feel like to go from 3.78 to 307 in 5 weeks is incredibly fast and seems like it has to be false. I have a PET scan scheduled for Monday, but I can't stop thinking about the Signatera results. Has anyone had a false positive Signatera test due to being sick or just a false positive in general?

So far I have only heard of one person having false positive results and she had a wild journey! After multiple positive tests, they changed it and said it was actually negative. 

I am still in active treatment, so it seems odd that it would increase that much in a short period of time.

Thank you!!!


UPDATE: I am providing an update just in case some one comes across this in the future and is in the same position. I got the results of my scan, and my cancer has progressed. It looks one nodule may be gone but the other one that shrunk to 9mm is now measuring 7.5 x 6.3 x 6.7 cm.
