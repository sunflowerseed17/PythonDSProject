I’m considering a bilateral nipple-sparing mastectomy with immediate DIEP flat reconstruction. Reading previous posts, I know the recovery with DIEP is a lot more brutal than DTI. (Wasn’t considering DTI but I might after reading some recovery posts.) I’ve read lots of posts about recovery/complications on the top half but not much on the bottom (stomach) half besides a large scar. I’m assuming the donor site will also have drains, so how do you manage/hide those? I also know that you can’t sit up straight for some time and need to walk hunched over a bit. For those who have had, what are some things or complications you didn’t expect with the donor site?
