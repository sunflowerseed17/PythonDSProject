Hi friends,

I got blury vision and light headed on and off alot since chemo. I also feel my eye gets weaker. On call doctor said its ok, nurse said blood sugar. But its not ok. I will go to opthomologist on Monday. However, its a 36 hours wait. I wondered if anyone had this side effect and what happened?
