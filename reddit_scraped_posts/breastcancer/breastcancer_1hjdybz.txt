I am in week two of my first round of TC chemo. I definitely reacted to the medication, as shortly after the drip started I had a strong reaction requiring some medical mitigation to be able to complete the infusion... 

However it's been a week and a half and I've had maybe some twinges of seasickness, a few extra naps, a mild headache, some little rashes, my scalp is starting to tingle, and my tumor has sometimes been aching. My appetite is fine, my sleep is on the better end of my perimenopause normal, and if I didn't know I were undergoing chemo it would just feel like a slightly-off normal day. I feel like if my hair doesn't start falling out it will feel like this isn't even real. Considering every bad flu, bad hangover, and bad bout of menopause symptoms I have had, this doesn't even make the top 20.

Has anyone started out easy-breezy and then had things get worse either later in the cycle or after subsequent cycles? I have rearranged my life in case I were to be feeling quite unwell for twelve weeks, and I may have over-prepared. On the other hand I don't want to get overconfident. I'm avoiding crowds but I'd love to do something like go for a long drive and know that I'm not going to get suddenly hit by nausea 20 miles from home.

My treatment plan is four rounds of neoadjuvant (Docetaxel/Cyclophosphamide) to be followed by surgery. 

IDC Stage II Grade 2 ++- Luminal B.

Can anyone who's been there talk some sense into me?
