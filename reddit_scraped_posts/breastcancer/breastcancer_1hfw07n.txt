Hi! I’m asked to provide three references, and was wondering if there is any best practices on how diverse these references should be? Is it ok if 2/3 are from my current employer? What about 3/3? 

I’m about 2 years post-grad and have also been at this job for about 2 years, so my list of references is on the shorter side right now. TIA.
