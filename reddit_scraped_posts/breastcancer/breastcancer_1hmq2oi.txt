Hello! I’ll be placing an order for an R1T in a couple weeks. I have an outlet that fits a NEMA 6-20 outlet in my garage (former owner used it for an air compressor). Will I be able to safely charge an r1t with a 6-20 adapter and a Tesla mobile charger?

Edit: I’m also 5 minutes from a new EA charger and 20 minutes from a Tesla L3 supercharger.
