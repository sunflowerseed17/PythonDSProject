I’m about to start radiation sometime soon. I have an appointment with the radiologist this week. 
I’m reading about radiotherapy and I was wondering if during the sessions they shield your thyroid and use a led blanket to protect the rest of the body?  Is this something they normally do or do I need to request? Thanks
