I start chemo Jan 9. My doctor recommended 4 rounds of TC (one infusion every 3 weeks). I am an elementary school teacher and I want to teach as much as possible during chemo. 
Any teachers with advice or even those who work in person jobs with set hours? I love my job but even fully healthy itâ€™s tiring! Which days should I definitely plan to be off? I know everyone is different, other than BC I am very healthy and active!
I have had to take 4 weeks off for my lumpectomy and re-excision. I miss my students!
