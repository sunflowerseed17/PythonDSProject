Diagnosis- 27F Left Breast Multifocal IDC stage 2B grade 3 Triple Negative (lymph node involvement)

I underwent a lumpectomy (for diagnosis) followed by 8 rounds of chemo and a single mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection. 
I received my pathology reports yesterday and looks like my breast tissue was in the clear, NED. They removed 19 lymph nodes and all of them were clear too except for one. There was minimal residual (0.2x0.1 cm) in that node.

My oncologist said we will go forward with radiation and I will have to take Olaparib for a year or two. 

As much relieved I was for the good results, I felt kind of bummed out when I was told that I will need maintenance meds. I mean I thought this would be over in 2 months, but this is going to go on for a year or so now. How bad could Olaparib even be, right? I feel like I just can't catch a break.
