Hi all!

Can you please recommend products I should be purchasing/using for before/during/after chemo? Meaning anything I should be doing or using night before/morning of, during treatment, and for post-treatment symptom management.

So far I've seen people recommend cooling eye masks to try to retain eyebrow hair, and compression socks/gloves for neuropathy (if anyone has links to specific items please post!)

I'd also appreciate it so much if you could provide links (or brands) to what you used/what worked for you. I have ADHDand get reqlly bad choice paralysis- knowing specifically what worked for/helped other people would  make it so much less stressful.

Thank you in advance!
