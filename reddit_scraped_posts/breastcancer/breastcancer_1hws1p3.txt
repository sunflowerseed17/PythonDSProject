I’m currently in the process of breast reconstruction with expanders, and I’m really struggling with whether I’m happy with the size or not. Before my surgery, I was a full D cup, and I’ve always wanted a reduction. But now with the expanders, I feel like I’m a full C cup (with a bra on), and I can’t quite figure out if I should go bigger, or if I’m nearing the size I want.

For those who have been through this process—how did you know when you’d reached your ideal size with the expanders? How did you decide when to stop expanding? I’m also having fat grafting done, which I know can impact the final look.

I’m looking for advice. Any guidance on how you navigated the process would be really helpful. I just want to feel confident with the size I end up with! I stopped the fills in December and an exchange will be in May. I figure I would give myself some time to see if this is the size I like but they are clunky so not sure there is a good answer.
