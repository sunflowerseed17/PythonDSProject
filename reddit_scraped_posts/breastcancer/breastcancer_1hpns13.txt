Was diagnosed with DCIS in early December. Grade 3 negative for hormones. It has been a whirlwind of a ride especially adding in the holiday. 
I had a MRI a few days ago that showed it was not in the lymph nodes. MRI showed it to be 2.5cm X 2.1cm.
I am currently in a fairly good head space with all of this. Prior to the MRI the treatment plan was lumpectomy with 4 weeks radiation or mastectomy. I do have small breast size B so not sure if the size of the DCIS compared to my chest will change how the Dr. wants to proceed.
I am most concerned about it coming back in fact that is what keeps me up. I am struggling to decide if I should just do the lumpectomy or mastectomy. Doctor said both have about the same outcome when you add in radiation. Any experience you can offer is greatly appreciated.
