Hello friends, I was put on Lupron & Letrozole in Sept/Oct 2023 for projected 5 years, with few problems initially. Slowly over the first half of 2024, my joint pain became brutal. By May, my onco told me I could take a one month break and then I switched to exemestane in June 2024.

I also added in collagen powder & a calcium supplement. I felt GREAT. I coasted through one year on AIs grateful that I had few side effects.

And then...

Since around Thanksgiving, my joint pain has grown unbearable. I added in Osteo-Biflex & tart cherry capsules a few weeks ago...nothing. I'm at the same level of pain as with letrozole, maybe more. (Plus, depression. Awesome!)

My onco just oked for me stop the exemestane for a couple of weeks and then start anastrazole. But really, now I'm just expecting "a good 6 months" before the joint pain kicks in again. A nurse on his team had told me that it seems when the side effects come on more slowly like mine have, they tend to stick around.

I know everyone reacts differently to AIs...but **anyone else had this "slow onset" joint pain and have luck with anastrozole? Or any other supplements that help?** (Although I'm probably taking too many supplements now and need to phase some out...haha.)

For reference, I'm currently 47, diagnosed at 45 in 2023 w/ Stage 1 grade 1 IDC, ++-, DMX, was premeno but pathology showed a couple of foci behind the bigger tumor, so onco feels the Lupron + AI route for 5 years is better than tamoxifen for 10.

Thanks y'all.
