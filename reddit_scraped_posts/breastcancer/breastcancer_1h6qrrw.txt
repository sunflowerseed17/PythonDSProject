I had a 50% weak/moderate result for ER and 1% moderate result for PR

The oncologist I saw today stated  they're viewing it as being ER+ and PR -, but want me to remove my Mirena IUD.

I find it odd since Mirena only has synthetic Progesterone but was willing to take it out (albeit while kicking and screaming internally).

I just read however about the "Mirena crash" and that your body gets lazy about producing its own Progesterone while having Mirena, meaning that once it's removed it could cause low Progesterone, in turn potentially raising estrogen levels.

Now I'm freaked out since taking it out seems to come with its own risks, and may be potentially worse if I'm considered er+, no?
