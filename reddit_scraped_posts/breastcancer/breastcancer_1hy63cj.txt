Hi, I understand this is a very small potatoes problem to have on chemo and for that I am truly grateful. I am seeking input from those who may have experienced it as my oncologist didn’t give much feedback other than saying it was good I gained and not lost weight!

I just finished the chemo portion of treatment for TNBC (keynote 522 protocol). I gained about 25 pounds. I really notice I am hungry quite often. I’m not sure if this is a side effect of chemo/steroids that will lessen with time, or if I should be pushing for something like a thyroid check (I know Keytruda can make things haywire). Anyone experience weight gain during chemo that righted itself once your body healed?  Thanks!
