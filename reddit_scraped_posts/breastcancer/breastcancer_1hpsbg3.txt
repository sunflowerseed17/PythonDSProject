I’m not good at makeup and don’t like to wear a lot of makeup. I’ve never had a good complexion, so I feel like I have to wear concealer/foundation. I don’t often wear much else. The products I’ve used (all things I can get at a drugstore, Walmart, etc.) help cover my blemishes, but accentuate my large pores. Like it cakes into the pores. I hate the pores and would love a product that smooths over them instead. I’ve tried inexpensive pore erasers before applying the foundation. It helps a little, but not a ton. 

I’m on hormone blockers for breast cancer that I think are affecting my already not-so-great complexion and I feel extra self-conscious not having my long hair anymore to hide the sides of my face when these breakouts are worse. 

I don’t have a lot of money, so really pricy things aren’t an option. I love a natural look and don’t want something that looks extra fake if that makes sense. Thank you!
