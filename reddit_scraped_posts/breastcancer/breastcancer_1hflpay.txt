Hi everyone,

Been on Zep since September and it's working great for me. I recently had an abnormal mammogram which led to a biopsy which led to a lumpectomy - and now the doctor is talking about putting me on an estrogen inhibitor pill like Tamoxifen or another inhibitor - some of those side effects are weight gain, which is the exact thing that Zep is trying to prevent!   
Anyone been on those drugs and Zep at same time?
