I am a week out of surgery and I am supposed to get my drain removed tomorrow. My drain output is way below 20 ml, it has been that way from the past 3 days. But until yesterday it was yellow and now suddenly it has become redder and redder. It's still transparent, just tinted red. Has this happened to anyone? The output still seems to be low.
