Hi everyone, I have never posted here before though I have read many of the posts and gained a lot from the communal wisdom. Thanks in advance for that and cheers if anyone can weigh in on this question:

I had my BMX in Sept of 2024 (following stage 1 grade 2 ++-; no chemo or rads), and my implant exchange surgery was scheduled for about 4 months later, this February. I don't mind the tissue expanders so much, despite the odd look and feel I am pretty comfortable (they are over the muscle). The reason I am thinking to put it off is that I live alone with my 2.5 year old; when I had my BMX his father temporarily moved in to help (I had friends and family over too but needed someone to sleep over every night to get baby out of crib when he wakes up, which is often). My ex and I are amicable and close, but the forced cohabitation put a lot of strain on our relationship and everyone around us.

As this next surgery is rapidly approaching (which I am dreading not for the implant swap so much as the childcare/relationship issues it will likely cause) I started wondering, if I could just put the surgery off for a year or so give or take, I could recuperate without needing anyone to move in. I realize I will still need extra hands for *other* lifting, but won't need to be constantly lifting my child cause by that point he won't be sleeping in a crib or changed on a changing table, etc. 

I actually don't even know if I get to make this choice - if my surgeon / insurance will approve the deferral, if there is anything wrong with holding onto the TE's, etc. Has anyone elected to put this off for personal/childcare-related (i.e. not medical) reasons? Is this not a good idea? Am I missing the big picture? Thanks for reading this.
