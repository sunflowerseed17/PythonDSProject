First let me say how absolutely grateful I am to this group. When I was diagnosed last week, I absolutely spiraled out of my mind being TNBC. Not a single soul could get me off the crazy ledge except the amazing individuals in this group. I have no words to express what beautiful beacons of light you have been for me in my darkest moment. ðŸ¥¹ðŸ¥¹

I start chemo next week. I have no idea what I should take with me. How should I dress? Iâ€™m doing the first 3 rounds via an IV and not a port bc of the surgeon being out of town. Has anyone done it via IV? What advise can you give me ? Help a pink sister out. ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—
