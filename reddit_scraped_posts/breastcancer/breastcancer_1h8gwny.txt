My surgeon told me that for her institution, after axillary dissection, the bypass is only done on for the arm, and not breast.  
  
If you have experience with bypass, what is done for both arm and breast?  
  
Also, there is comment that the bypass might be destroyed by radiation. Have you heard about this?  
  
Thank you.
