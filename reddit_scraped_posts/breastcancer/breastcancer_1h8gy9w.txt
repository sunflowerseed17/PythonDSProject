Today’s my breakdown day apparently. I’ve held my ish together for so long. I sobbed when I was first diagnosed in July but since then I’ve endured all the stuff this asshole disease has thrown at me. I’m going through rads right now, and it sucks. I didn’t expect to feel sooo exhausted. Rebecca (the party tit who has overdone it) isn’t too sore or angry, yet, thank goodness. I feel worn down to nothing. What put me over the edge you ask? Dog pee in my bedroom. And then my garage door wouldn’t close and that’s it. Cue the water works. I know those things are not what the tears are about but…
