Ok everyone, I’ve made it through 16 rounds of chemo (12 TC, 4 AC completed 11/8) and DMX on 12/4 with DIEP reconstruction scheduled for 1/15. My lymph nodes came back clear (a miracle) so I don’t need radiation but my breast tissue still had 3mm left of a 9cm tumor so I’m looking at more chemo. I thought I was done. This alone is making me so very sad, but I can handle Xeloda. However, my doc recommended a trial of Trodelvy which I am just not a fucking fan of. I will lose my hair (again- it’s just starting to come back). More nausea/diarrhea. More exhaustion. Every time I think about doing 6 more months of chemo I just start crying. It’s so daunting. And, I know, it’s only 6 months. If one more person tells me that I may slap them. 

So I guess I just wanted to put some feelers out there to see if anyone has had experience with Trodelvy or Xeloda or whatever. Not really looking to be told that 6 months isn’t a long time in the big scheme of things. Any other insight is welcome lol.
