After an extra 2 week break, a blood transfusion, and my blood counts improving, I get to endure #4 tmrw. 25% reduction in both chemo drugs, so in crossing my fingers that it won't be as harsh or it will at least keep me out of the hospital. I'm drinking a gallon of water today to Jumpstart the hydration. Hopefully I can keep up the drinking because it's such a struggle once Day 3 hits. They're also giving me extra oral steroids to take if my nausea gets out of control again.
I'm really crossing my fingers that I'm able to handle this one better!!!
