Today I had a conversation with a friend from church and she shared  her mom had breast cancer while ago… she has been cancer free for 18 years! 
She told me her mom was on her  late 40s  when she was diagnosed with stage 2 , and one positive lymph node. She went through , lumpectomy, chemo, radiation and 5years on tamoxifen.  She told me she will put me in contact with her mom.  She is now a grandma of 6 cute kids. 
I just want to share this with you all . 

Edit: I was diagnosed in October and speaking to survivors and people that are going through has been so helpful. I’m thankful for this group it has helped me greatly . In the beginning I was overwhelmed with so many questions and I found a lot of the answerers here. Thank you!
