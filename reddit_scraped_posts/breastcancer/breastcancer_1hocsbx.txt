I am a kiwi in my 40s, 5 years post double mastectomy. Couldn’t have reconstruction at the time and now scheduled for delayed reconstruction in 2025. Breast surgeon has agreed to turn my tummy fat into breasts. I’m getting fit and strong and now second guessing my decision. I don’t want to ‘ruin my body’ internally. Also unsure about the tummy shape after and if I will regret. Don’t like the idea of implants but would be so much more straight forward and kinder on my body. Looking for pros and cons and real life experiences. Why did you choose tram flap over implants and are you happy with your decision?? Thanks!
