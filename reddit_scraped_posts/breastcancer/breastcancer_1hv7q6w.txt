So I am here 16 years after my bout with Stage 0 cancer - now looking at a small ish 1.2 cm tumor, grade 2, no hormone info yet, in the same breast, which had two previous lumpectomies and radiation.    Mastectomy is my only choice, but I see this note of "micro papillary features" which is greatly freaking me out?   Anyone ever have that?  I am trying to avoid chemo, but maybe I won't be able to.   I just got through a recurrence of skin cancer on my nose, a 5 hour MOHS surgery and a nickel size skin graft at the tip.    WHAT!! Both in the same few months came back!
