So... I'm a bit of a depressive person and I've been really stewing in that depression since my diagnosis. I've been overly concerned with trivial cosmetic imperfections with my AFC and how much treatment options suck. And they do. But it hit me last night... I had a brush with death!!! Horrible, painful death by cancer if left untreated. And I'm worried about if the scar makes me ugly? Omg who cares! I am so so so grateful that my breast was removed when it was. Holy shit.

I'm looking in the mirror and am loving my scar and my one-boob body. I can't believe I'm saying that with how much I've been struggling with my body image following surgery. But I feel really foolish for focusing on tiny cosmetic stuff and not with the cancer itself. 100 years ago I would have died a slow, torturous death in my 30s. But today I just have to give up my breast and maybe my hair and I probably get to survive invasive cancer? Hell yeah I'm on board. Give me whatever treatment I need.

Most people here probably already have this perspective but I have been really blind to what's important thanks to my depression. It really is amazing that our bodies can take a beating from cancer and treatment and keep on thriving. I'm so awestruck at everyone who goes through this. I'm so proud of us and our bodies. We are beautiful with our scars and asymmetries and radiated skin. They are visible signs that we fought to survive. I don't know how I ever saw it as ugly.

So grateful for this overdue perspective shift, and for all you lovely lovely people!! Be well ðŸ©·
