My medical oncologist suggested a oncotype test to determine if I need chemo or not. I was diagnosed early stage hormone positive BC. My insurance denied coverage stating it’s medically unnecessary. 

Is it worth my time and effort to appeal this? Has anyone had similar experiences? 

I just don’t understand how it’s not medically necessary if the purpose was to determine if I need chemo or not. 

Update: I looked through more of my recent claims and found that the lymph node tracer injection  (dye to locate right  lymph node) was also deemed “medically unnecessary” and a huge bill bill for a tumor immunohistochemistry analysis was also “medically unnecessary”. How do they get to make these decisions?
