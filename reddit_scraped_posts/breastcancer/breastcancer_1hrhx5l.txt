I was diagnosed with fibroadenoma on my left breast in 2022; I was delighted. Fast forward to February 2024, I started experiencing aches, pain, and discomfort in my breast. I assumed it was the fibroadenoma. In October, I scheduled a mamo and ultrasound, and no changes were found in the fibroadenoma. So, I thought it was my breast implants I had 5 years with.  I got an explant in November. The pain subsided, but it came back worse with a burning sensation. I went to urgent care on New Year's Eve and got an ultrasound the same day. A circumscribed hypoechoic nodule or cyst with debris was found. I am devastated because they couldn’t correctly diagnose me or refer me for a biopsy. The pain is so bad I feel this time I wont be lucky. My fibrodenoma is slippery and painless but this new lump is the opposite.
