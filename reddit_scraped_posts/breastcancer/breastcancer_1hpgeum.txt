My BMX is scheduled for 12/31 and I was told earlier that the sentinel node process would be done at the same time.  Two days ago I learned that the Nuclear Medicine dept was closed on New Years Eve so I will have to have a radioactive dye injected the day before, then return for surgery the next day. I've held it together pretty well until now but now I'm a nervous wreck. I was not given any details about the sentinel node process.

Does the dye get injected into my breast next to the tumor, or is it injected in my underarm?  I assume that the dye will somehow travel to the lymph node closest to the tumor, that on the day of surgery some sort of X-ray or detector will be used to locate that lymph node, and then the surgeon will remove or biopsy that node.  Is the pathology on the sentinel node then done in real time while I'm still under general anesthetic?  If they find cancer in the node, will other nodes be removed at that time, or will I have to go back to the hospital later, while healing from the mastectomy, for another procedure to remove nodes?
