Hi so I’m stage 4 I have gotten keytruda the last year every 3 weeks, my last one was December 20th.

This past month because of Christmas and being sick I am 2 weeks later than normal so instead of 3 weeks inbetween I’m 5. I have been feeling even more bad and also my period is late. Keytruda does mess with my hormones and I was wondering if anyone else has had worse if they had larger gaps with no Keytruda or if they stopped and had bad nausea, hot snakes, and headaches stuff like that.
