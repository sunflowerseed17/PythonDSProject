I was supposed to have an appointment with the plastics on 1/8 so I can start planning surgery dates with my breast Onco. Part of me is soo frustrated that it rescheduled all the way to March and that they can’t accommodate me next week since I live 2 hours away. BUT, with the whole fire situation , I also feel that I do not have the right to feel this way since it’s really out of everyone’s hands. I feel a bit ashamed  of feeling frustrated. 
Stage 1 DCIS on the right breast with PTEN and getting a DBMX. ER+ PR+ Her2 - 

I am only rushing to meet reconstruction because I do not want to get surgery twice since I have high anxiety and low pain tolerance. 

I have thought about jumping to another hospital/provider that may possibly see me in quicker. I don’t need a second opinion, I just want to get it done asap. The only con for this, is that my GYN Onco is in the same hospital as my breast Onco. If I jump to another hospital/prpvider, logistic for my care planning with my GYN will get tricky. Also, the thought of having to start from “scratch” with another provider and going through all of the emotions again will be quite daunting. Any advice or thoughts will be greatly appreciated.
