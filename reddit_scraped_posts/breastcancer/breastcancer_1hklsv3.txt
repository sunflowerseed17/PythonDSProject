I have no history of nosebleeds. I had a couple of small nosebleeds during my first round of TCHP back in March. I’ve been off of TC since June. Still going w/HP until March of next year. I’m on my 5th month of taking daily Letrozole and monthly Zolodex injections. I’ve had 3 recent nosebleeds (enough to be dripping out - not just trace amounts or dried blood). There are globs of blood in my spit as well (currently having a nosebleed, so it’s connected to that). 

Just wondering if this was normal or if others have experienced it? Thanks!
