So, I should be done with chemo in three months and would like to clean the carpets of the place I'm renting then. My dog, who usually never goes in the house, has peed on the carpet a few times acting out from moving, and has also had some diarrhea and vomiting inside. I've cleaned those when they've happened but would like to do a more through clean after chemo.  Can I steam clean with maybe some rubbing alcohol added in or sprayed on the carpet before steaming? Not sure if this would be safe with a steam cleaner.

  
Edit/update: thanks for the weight ins.  I'm wondering if anyone knows anything about carpet cleaning after chemo, specifically to address any residual meds that may have gotten on the carpet from sweaty feet?  I know the amount, if anything, would be negligible, but it's still something I wonder about since I know people with multiple chemical sensitivities who are very concerned about meds getting into carpet etc.  There is not much literature on this.
