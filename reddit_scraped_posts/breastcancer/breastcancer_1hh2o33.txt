Background: I am 38 year old female who went in for annual app with OBGYN (September this year). Mentioned I felt something in right breast. During her self exam she didn't feel anything, said I had "fiberous? breast tissuue." She asked a few follow up questions, If I felt it more at different times of the month (yes) and if I drank a lot of caffeine (also yes.) Something didn't sit right with me, and kept nagging on me to explore further, so I requested a mammogram/ultrasound which I completed yesterday.  Below are my results. I am scheduled for two different biopsies next week. I am already of the mindset that it is C and I just need to brace myself for what's next, but any insight based on the below?? as in what the below really means? Spiculated is not good, no   
axillary adenopathy I take as somewhat good? Other than that I am clueless??

Ultrasound:

Highly Suggestive of Malignancy (ACR-Category-5)

FINDINGS: Initial targeted ultrasound imaging of the lateral breast performed in  
region of self detected palpable findings. Abnormal suspicious hypoechoic  
spiculated mass at 9:00 measuring 1.4 x 1.3 x 1.3 cm. This finding represents  
focal region of mass/architectural distortion on diagnostic mammography. No  
axillary adenopathy.

The mammographic/ultrasound findings were directly discussed with the patient on  
the morning of 12/17/2024. The patient will be scheduled for targeted ultrasound  
core biopsy of suspicious palpable solid mass at 9:00. Additional targeted  
stereotactic biopsy of additional scattered indeterminate upper outer quadrant  
microcalcifications. A brief history and physical was performed and recorded.
