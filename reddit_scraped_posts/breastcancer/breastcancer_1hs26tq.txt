Copied and pasted from FB. I'm a volunteer at ACAR, and the treats are so appreciated by the dogs and cats. Please help out if you can! It's an easy way to support your local shelter. 

>DONATION REQUEST- TREATS! We are in very desperate need of both dog and cat treats! We can make use of ANY brand, but here are a few specific items we also need: 

>Squeeze Cheese Churu/lickable wet treats for cats 

>Pupperoni, Milk Bones, and any other regular dog treats

>Donations can be dropped off in person Tuesday through Saturday, 10:30 - 5:30 or sent to us via our Amazon Wishlist (link below). We go through so many treats and are always in need, so we appreciate your support!
