I have been feeling so sad that my tumor didn't feel like it had shrunken, I can still feel a big mass, which has stayed the same since the first 2 doses of chemo. I was so discouraged and demotivated and worried. 

I had my mid-way MRI on Monday and I just checked the portal and saw the results. I'm meeting with my nurse tomorrow morning, where she can tell me more, but the portal gave me very good news. I've had 4 sets of chemo and have 5 left. HER2+, grade 3, stage 3b. 

It started out with a multifocal tumor that was 7x7x5 cm big and now it has gone down to two separate areas that are smaller: 1.7 cm and 0.9 cm and also those are much less aggressive in contrast fluid uptake, just slightly more than normal. The edema covering my whole right breast is gone. The many lymph nodes involved earlier in my armpit and parasternal are looking almost normal (most of them have no uptake)!

I know some of you start your journey with tumors matching my now smaller sized ones. And I know I still need to get rid of the rest. But damn, I feel so happy that this is what it looks like now on the MRI! It makes me motivated to keep going with TCHP. ðŸ¤© My future looks so much brighter today! Yeeeeah!
