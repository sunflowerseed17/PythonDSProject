I had my “last” round of TCHP last week and….this shit is just as hard as the first round. I can’t believe how sick I am and how bad I feel. Round 5 was nothing compared to this. The weather is definitely making it harder to bounce back- it’s so cold and I’m constantly shivering. But the weakness, the diarrhea, food aversions, and the hair loss on top of how cold I am are crippling me so much I feel like I am dying. I can’t stop crying because I feel so sick and worthless. 

I’m supposed to go back in 3 weeks for HP and just continue on but….i don’t know how i can. I want to give up and die.
