Hi, I did search for plant plastic and bio bags but didn't see much come up.  Anyhow, I'm wondering if the non-fossil plant-based alternatives are much healthier.  I don't know what changes may happen in the processing process, and if the raw materials that biobags are made from may undergo changes that make them acquire some of the harmful properties of plastics.  Same question for the non-fossil plant-based plastic food wrap products that are out there.  Thanks!
