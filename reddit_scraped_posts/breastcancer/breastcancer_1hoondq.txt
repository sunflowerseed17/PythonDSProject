Hello everyone. Currently, I am struggling with being able to tell the difference between the side effects that brain radiation had on my aunt and her overall progression of disease. 

Her palliative care and hospice team has been really notorious for dropping the ball on a lot of different things so I was wondering if anyone had any advice.

Her breast cancer is stage four and has spread to her brain, liver, lungs, bone, and stomach. She underwent 10 days of brain radiation that ended on November 20th. We are hoping she will get stronger to be able to do chemo again but the doctors gave her months to live about a month ago after finding how much it spread. 

Any advice on how to tell the difference would be amazing. Thank you. 

EDIT: I’m mainly asking for other experiences with stage 4 breast cancer and brain radiation. I promise I’m not asking anyone to tell me when her time is going to be. If her or I had the support of her care team I would not have reached out to the internet for help. It was a last resort.
