Hi everyone, 

I (37f) was diagnosed just under 2 weeks ago (BRCA2+, TNBC, lymph node involvement), and still waiting on staging CT and MRI results (bone scan was clear). I see the oncologist on Tuesday. 

I have been coping ok but tonight I am really really scared. I'm scared that the cancer has already spread and I'm really scared of chemo and I'm kinda just. Generally scared. I feel like a small kid who wants a grown up.
