I just started ozempic for weightloss after breast cancer treatment (fat holds hormones that feed my type of breast cancer)

I also take something called a Rick Simpson Oil every night which is used as an anti cancer effort. It's a very strong marijuana oil. I'm very familiar with marijuana use, but I noticed that on my third week of ozempic, I don't get high when I take my weed oil at night. Instead, I get SUPER high the next morning. It's insane.

My husband takes contrave and started experiencing the exact same thing early on after starting contrave (contrave is not semaglutide, it's naltrexone and buproprion)

My only bit of reasoning right now is that somehow weightloss drugs change the way we metabolize THC??

Has anyone else had this experience? It started with my husband in the summer because he's been on contrave longer than I've been on ozempic. I thought maybe he was weird.

Now that it's happening to me, I figure this MUST happen to others.
