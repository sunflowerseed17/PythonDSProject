I was diagnosed with stage 2 grade 2 IDC on December 3, 2024 after finding a lump in October. I have absolutely no genetic markers for it. It’s HER2+, Estrogen+ but progesterone -. I have lymph node involvement. I just had my 1st of 6 rounds of chemotherapy, I’m going every 3 weeks for chemo. Any advice would be lovely. I started chemo this morning & already feel like crap.
