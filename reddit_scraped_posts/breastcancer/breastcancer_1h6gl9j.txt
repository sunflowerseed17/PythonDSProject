Hi everyone, did your doctor order any blood work to check your levels of progesterone, estrogen and thyroid after your diagnosis?
Iâ€™m 43 female diagnosed with BC . ER 100%, PR100% and Her 2 negative.  Genetic test came clear and low Oncotype . 
I was wondering if hormonal imbalance are present or common when we have ER+, PR+ tumor. My dr ordered CBC blood work , checked for iron levels and vitamin D. But none of the blood tests checked for my thyroid, estrogen or progesterone hormones.
