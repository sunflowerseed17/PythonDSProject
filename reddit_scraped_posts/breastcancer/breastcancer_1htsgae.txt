My husband just said it feels like he's already lost me and all that's left is just cancer. 

I'm just over a month from diagnosis and at day 3 of neo adjuvant keynote 522 (with weekly paclitaxel). He's been doing a good job of coming to appointments and stuff but sorta been avoiding his feelings and hiding a lot. Like. There's been days where when I walk into a room he goes to another room. I thought he just needed space but right now I feel really really rejected.

It really hurt to hear him say that. I did not react well. Like. I know he's experiencing a loss and it's hard and all that. And. Cancer is happening to me. It's not all of me. WTF 
(I've been naming that I can't be there the way I have been in the past for a while, and he is just. Stuck. I'm SO MAD I have no grace for him right now).
