My MIL passed in April. Lots of family drama as a result. I was in a car accident in September (on my way to get my annual mammo) and lost my car. Got my mammo in October and it's been a rollercoaster ride since. My teen was hospitalized last month for the upteenth time for her mental health. I've cried so many times this year. I'm constantly breaking down. I'm angry. I see a therapist weekly and take meds for my depression. I don't want to be this angry. I don't want to be a walking mess. I've been strong for my teen's health woes. I can't be strong anymore. I'm tired.

23.27mm mass (removed a few weeks ago), right breast, 12 o'clock. ++-, Stage 1A for now. Another surgery scheduled for tmrw. 

If I could describe 2024 in one word, it would be grief. 

Thank you for listening to my rant.
