Hello! Im writing this because I was diagnosed with stage 2a triple positive breast cancer at 28. I did neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (TCHP). Achieved PCR when I did my DMX. My question is, are there any younger survivors in here that can tell mw how you're coping? Im a total hypochondriac now just digging into my chest daily looking for recurrence. Its just absolutely exhaustingðŸ˜”
