Screening Mammogram 10-15, diagnostic mammogram/ultrasound 10-30, 2 Right breast biopsies 11-5, Left breast biopsy 11-15, Met with breast surgeon 10-1, breast MRI and the only result I'm waiting for is genetic testing. FIinal
Results-- DCIS in left breast and a possible other DCIS in that breast (Birads 4). 2 Er positive, grade 2, Her2 negative diagnosed tumors in the right breast with over 8 cm of MRI enhancements the out
the breast but no known lymph node involvement. Upgraded from Stage 1 to a late stage 2 possibly a 3. Meeting with the surgeon on 12-19 to hopefully schedule surgery and it's hard to think of anything other than this cancer. I'm consumed with it almost 24/7. What if I'm too late and spreads over the next few weeks. I feel like I'm going crazy and would appreciate any comments ðŸ’•
