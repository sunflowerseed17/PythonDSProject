Hi all,

I've recently had a lumpectomy & am currently dealing with seroma & leakage from the wound - it's been a nightmare, but that's another story.

Tomorrow, I go back to my oncologist surgeon and he is supposed to talk with me about going on a pill so that these calcifications (DCIS?) do not return. I've heard various things about Tamoxifen and AIs and all of them make me want to avoid the drug but I also know I don't want to go thru another lumpectomy or have anything come back. There is no breast cancer in my family history. I have been in menopause for 9+ years and have had a hysterectomy. 

Any thoughts? Feel scared and alone and googling the meds just makes it worse.
