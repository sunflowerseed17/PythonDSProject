Some positive words for all who are worrying about medically induced menopause - like I was 3 months ago.

I (F, 35) started hormone therapy on the 1st of November and all I can say that it's not that bad. I feel like my body is adjusting to the lack of oestrogen quite quickly. I think one of the benefits of having a medically induced menopause,  is that your body doesn't get teased with oestrogen inflxues every now and then - thereâ€™s just none, so your system can just switch from one way of working to another. Not scientifically proven ofcourse :).

Ofcourse I do have hot flushes, but they're not that bad. My knees are more sensitive, but I take supplements for that. My nights are broken, but I take CBD or I meditate when I wake up. Also taking hours before sleep to wind down (no phone/screens or exciting activities) really helps.  Atm I'm trying to see it as extra time I have that normally my body would need to handle the hormone fluctuations.

The hardest thing was my low mood when I was supposed to get my period - but luckily living in the Netherlands, I could bridge the shortage of serotonin with Psilocybin.

I hope if you still have to start hormone therapy and you're worried, that this takes away a bit of worry.  It's really not that bad, and we are resilient AF :)
