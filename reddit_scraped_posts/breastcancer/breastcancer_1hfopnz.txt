So I just had my lumpectomy on Friday and I got a bunch of recommended stuff like compression bras and a wedge pillow, I tried to prep myself to learn to sleep on it leading up to the surgery but no dice, I gave up and decided to enjoy side sleeping for as long as I could (I'm a stomach/side sleeper, I can sleep on my back but have a harder time falling asleep).

So post surgery its been a pain to doze off. Should I get some specific kind of pillow to make it easier to sleep on this thing?
