Hello! I know that the best answer to my q's will be from a doctor/professional but that doesn't stop me from turning to my BC reddit crew too. 

Background: Microinvasive cancer alongside extensive DCIS, no lympnodes. Age 45. ER positive 71-80%, PR negative, Her2 positive. Double mastecomy with radiation due to insufficient margins. Doc recommended AGAINST endocrine/hormone therapy (I was relieved to hear that), based on mastectomy, size of invasive area (.1 mm) and that additional pathology showed lesser ER positivity (I don't have the detailed report on that) actually making me a bad candidate for the treatment. 

I'm changing insurance so I'll have all new doctors shortly, and I'm pretty sure I am perimenopausal with some new symptoms (recurrent UTIs).  They will likely suggest/offer estrogen cream...Or I'll inquire about it...? I just want to know what options there are. BUT, I don't really understand how HRT would work for me, is it a bad idea, can ER+ cancer patients ever use it? What have others encountered? Not getting another cancer diagnosis is my #1 concern but quality of life is a close second. Really new to this, help! Any resources welcome.
