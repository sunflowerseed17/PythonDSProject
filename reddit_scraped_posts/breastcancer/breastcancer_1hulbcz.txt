This was my pathology report released on my patient portal this evening.  

INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA (up to 0.45 cm), arising in a background of DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU, high nuclear grade (solid, clinging, and cribriform patterns), with comedo necrosis and calcifications. 

Estrogen receptor (ER): LOW POSITIVE (10%, weak to moderate) - Progesterone receptor (PR): NEGATIVE (0%)
HER2: POSITIVE (3+) (>90% cells)

Now What Happens?
