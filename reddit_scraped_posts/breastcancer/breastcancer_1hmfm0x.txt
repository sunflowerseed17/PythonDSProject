Diagnosed triple positive in March, have more treatment until March 2025 and Iâ€™ve been lucky Iâ€™ve most avoided the aggressive touchers but at my in-laws house for Christmas and my sister in lawâ€™s mother (I donâ€™t know this lady all that well) always runs up to me and touches my face and leans in too close and rubs my arm and legs. Iâ€™m not a touchy person, and she never spoke much to me, now  itâ€™s all the time. And always more touching. Itâ€™s always so jarring I never know what to say! This time I couldnâ€™t help wince, maybe she noticedâ€¦probably not. Merry Christmas to me, I got to feel like a kid again with aunts always touching your cheeks. ðŸ˜‚
