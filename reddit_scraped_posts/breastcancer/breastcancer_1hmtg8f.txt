I have a love/hate relationship with MyChart. I love being privy to all the information that the doctors see, but that’s just the thing…I see it before they do and I TOTALLY FREAK OUT. 

Case in point: about a week and a half ago I had blood drawn for the genome test Empower Comprehensive (2+79). Today, I saw the results on MyChart. On one hand it sounds very good: “I’m negative for 80 out of 81 genes tested.” On the other hand, it said: “A pathogenic variant in the ATM gene called c.8418+5_8418+8del was detected.” 

My doctor had told me there was a very slim chance I wouldn’t have to take Tamoxifen if my genes showed something-or-another. I prayed for that and asked all my friends to pray for that, as well. Now after reading through the report, although not being well-versed in “cancer”, I‘ve deduced that my genes didn’t show something-or-another. In other words, I fear I’m going to have to take Tamoxifen for 5 long years.
