It feels like a Month has passed since dealing with my HER2+ diagnosis.  Scheduling appointments with my oncologist & surgeon.  Needing a MRI guided biopsy on the other breast because of 2 suspicious areas.  Making the necessary hotel accommodations.  

And... I only got "The Call" that I have breast cancer this past Monday. 

Anyone Else?
