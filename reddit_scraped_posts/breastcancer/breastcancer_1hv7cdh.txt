So I’m up for one soon. I’m non-binary and had been considering top surgery anyway, so I consider that a big bonus in that I’m not grieving my breasts on top of cancer. 

But I’m interested in how the surgery might differ. I haven’t spoken with the onc surgeon yet, and my area is fairly trans friendly- but obviously that’s not this surgeon’s focus. 

I guess I’m concerned about appearance. I’m planning to build up my muscles in my arms and chest, but will the goal for a flat be the same as for trans top surgery? 

Additionally if there are any known groups for top surgery folks who also have cancer, that would be great.
