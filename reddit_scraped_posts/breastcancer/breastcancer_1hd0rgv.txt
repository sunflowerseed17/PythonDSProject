I went for my follow up mammogram after treatment and the doctor seemed so annoyed that my breasts were still dense. She asked how long I had been on tamoxifen and I said since June. She said my breasts were still dense and an mri would be needed. Anyone else have this issue while on tamoxifen? I also still get periodsâ€¦they are very light but I still have them.
