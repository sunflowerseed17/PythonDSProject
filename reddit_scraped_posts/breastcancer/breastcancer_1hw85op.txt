I am hardcore spiraling today for what feels like no apparent reason. I had some fixation on my death for a while. Now im nearing the end of chemo and have had an amazing response, but as the end draws near ( 3 more AC and surgery) I am fixating heavily on what survivorship will look like. I broke down crying on my drive home because this whole thing feels like a sick joke!  I am not sure if its me deciding to go back to school in the fall or what… but its so hard to be able to see what my life will be like after. And theres some odd sadness about it being all over… maybe… I am not 100% sure what is rolling around in this head of mine. And perhaps I worked myself into this spiral by listening to Future Lover by Daughter on repeat all morning while I pushed to finish a project at work. 

But this thing rolls one of two ways and neither feels good right now. It feels terrifying. And it shouldnt. Because I have mostly been living life as I had prior to being diagnosed. But this feels daunting to confront. I guess next steps are always hard. 

I called my therapist to make an appt. So I should be ready and willing to unpack this and some other stuff.
