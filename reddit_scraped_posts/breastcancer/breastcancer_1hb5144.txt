I got diagnosed with cancer back in May of this year. I just finished chemotherapy and will be consulting with a surgeon soon. I'm trying to get my finances in order. Here's what I have done so far. 

I called two of my credit card companies to get on their disaster relief programs. The card that I owe the most debt to is on a long-term plan. I've been paying it off and have lowered it from $10,000 to $7,000. I just started on the second card. I owe $3,000. I agreed to the short-term plan for that one, paying $50 per month with no interest for one year. I plan on paying over $50 to lower it faster if I'm able to. I won't be able to use any of these cards, but it's worth it to remove the interest rates.

I need advice on my car payments and insurance. One car is $822 per month. The insurance policy is $449 per month because it's covers two cars. I called my insurance agent. The option for it is to change the other car, which is fully paid off, to a liability. It only takes $50 off the $449. 

My internet bill is $125. I have xfinity. At the time, it was the only available option in my area. Att&t just became available for $60 for new customers. I called them to get information but got irritated by the overwhelming salesperson. Any advice on this would be appreciated. 

I don't pay for mortgage or other utilities. I live with my mom and brother. They have been covering that portion since my diagnosis. I used to pay for the trash bill. My mom pays for it now. I was approved for financial assistance to cover my medical treatment but not labs or individual doctors who are out of network. These two have totaled to $500. I've been collecting the bills and calling customer  service to make sure the bills are being covered by my financial assistance program. I'm trying to make sure I don't make unnecessary payments. They are quick to take your money, but the refund takes a long time to process.
