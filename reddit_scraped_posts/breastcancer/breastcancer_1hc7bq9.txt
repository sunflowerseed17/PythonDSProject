I am Er+, PR- negative, Her 2 negative in one area (DCIS/IDC) and ER+, PR +, Her 2 negative(DCIS/IDC  in another area in the same breast. In the other breast I have two areas of DCIS in the other breast. I am stage 2A (could change). I consulted with two breast surgeons. One wanted to do a single mastectomy in one breast and a lumpectomy in the other (the one with DCIS). followed by Chemotherapy. The second surgeon recommended a double mastectomy followed by radiation. Both said I would need long term pill after. I was wondering if anyone else had a similar situation and how you managed the decision.
