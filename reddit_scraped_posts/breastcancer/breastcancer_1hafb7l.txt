Hi everyone. I’m diagnosed IDC HER2 only. Lymph nodes included.

I have my 5th round of TCHP tomorrow and I just found out that they’re removing the Taxotere this round because my liver enzymes results are too high.
I’m kind of worried that this will impact my results of taking away the cancer.
I’m wondering if anyone else has gone through this?
