in my early twenties and just finished a year of treatment for triple + yay!!! however, the 11 lines on my forehead are veryyyy deep now and iâ€™m wondering if anyone here has found something that works to help counteract that?? :( i know thatâ€™s an age old (haha) question and itâ€™s probably irreversible but just wanted to ask. cancer sucks
