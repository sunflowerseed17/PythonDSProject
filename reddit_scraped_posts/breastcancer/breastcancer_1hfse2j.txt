Hi friends! Looking for advice from anyone who has done the Livestrong program. I want to get the most out of my 12 weeks, so I'm wondering if I should just start it now, or if I should wait until I'm a bit stronger to get more from it.

I finished chemo in November and have now been on Lupron and examestane for a couple weeks. I am getting enough energy back that I've been able to get on the treadmill 20 minutes most days. My muscles are often sore, but movement helps. My flexibility is abysmal, so I've started working on that with some stretching at home. My strength wasn't great to begin with and is now worse. I've started doing some exercises with those giant rubber band things at home to work on upper body strength. I get my port out tomorrow. My goals are to feel strong and healthy, and I would also love to improve my posture and build my pec muscles (I had flat closure).

Would you advise me to sign up for Livestrong as soon as I'm healed from port removal, or should I try to get a bit better exercise capacity by exercising at home for a few months before I sign up? Thanks!
