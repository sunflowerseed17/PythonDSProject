I had my 6th and last chemo round  on dec 23rd, and around new years eve I started noticing my arms felt funny, tight as if I was wearing many layers of clothing. My fingers were a bit swollen and my face was puffer. Nothing too alarming. Days passed and I had more days with diarrea than in previous cycles during my second week. I slept more and had to rest sometimes during the day. 

After my third week I woke up one day with my face swollen, not allergic reaction but fluid retention swollen. My feet and ankles were normal. My breathing was ok, but I noticed a weird feeling in my belly where my liver and pancreas should be. Fingers swollen too. I took pictures and sent to my MO and she said nothing. I was scared of drinking fluids and make it worse. Then I read someone here referring to taxane capillary leak syndrome and I freaked out since it appears to be related to docetaxel, carboplatin, trastuzumab and filgrastim. And it appears to be a serious condition where fluid escapes your capillaries and goes to surrounding tissue causing mayhem. My dr called me and I forgot to ask her about that since she told me she was going to ask for a heart exam and freaked out about that too.

 After the first day of noticeable swollen face I started taking effexor 75mg but I am quitting it because of all the horror stories I read about it. Just took it for 3 days and 1 day of 37.5mg to get off it. 

So here's my question: have any of you experienced this? Waking up very swollen of your face and upper body? If so what did your doctors tell you? Are you being treated for it? Will it go away?
