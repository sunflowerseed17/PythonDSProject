It has been almost 2 weeks since I went to see the surgeon.  I have only had an ultrasound so far.  Everytime I call they say they are waiting on scheduling because they want to do several things at once (mammogram and biopsy).  

I called again today.  They said they are getting referrals in to a bigger medical center with more experience.  Apparently just from the exam (first and only time I have seen this Dr) and ultrasound from about a month previous, they are saying I am probably going to need a complete removal of my left breast and reconstructive surgery since I am so young (43).  

Should I really be worried or is this extra precaution that is normally done?
