I have some vintage playdoh molds and I want to make permanent 'casts' out of them. Since they're stiff plastic 2-part molds that fold in the middle, I'm finding it difficult to get the forms out cleanly. The only somewhat success I've had is with polymer clay and talc. Air dry clay shrinks and only hardens in thin layers, I've found. I guess the best thing to do would be to use a neutral color, bake-able polymer clay and then acrylic paint? I'd like the figures to not be super-brittle, though. I don't know if there's a magic substance out there (epoxy clays?) that would work out better? Thanks in advance!
