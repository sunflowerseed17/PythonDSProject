Hi guys! I’m new here. I wish everyone here all the best with their cancer journeys. I found out a week or so ago that I have breast cancer (HER negative, progesterone/oestrogen positive) with current lymph node involvement. I had an MRI and a PET scan recently. My breast surgeon said there was no indication the cancer is anywhere else, but my oncologist said that the PET scan picked up a couple of nodes in my lungs. I’m going in for a CT scan tomorrow. I’m wondering has anyone else had the experience of getting conflicting information like that? Why would they say that?

Also any success stories about living with stage 4 (if it is that) would be REALLY appreciated.

I’m in Australia and just started hormone therapy (just in case I use different names for drugs).
