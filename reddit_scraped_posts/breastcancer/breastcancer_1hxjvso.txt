Hello everyone. I finished my last taxol chemo and an considering getting microblading or microshading.  My oncologist claims to have no idea about what it is. But I'm wondering if any of you know the suggested number of weeks or months to wait to get something like this done after chemo. I am very over drawing on my eyebrows and was considering before my diagnosis as well.
