hey all ☺️

i was blonde half my life, naturally a 4-5 level i guess with a lot reddish pigments 
i cant afford the salon anymore and i dont wana bleach myself since it ended in damaged hair.

i did my hair years ago with high lift from keune 1517 + 12% developer and it came out ‚pretty ok‘ but my try yesterday came out orange !!! idk what i did wrong… i left it about 45mins maybe i should
leave it on longer or they changed the formula idk?! 
any high lift blondes which can kill my red pigments? im ok with yellowish blonde, i just dont want orange.

ill post pics…
1. pic is my highlighted hair with grow out so you can see my natural color
2+3 are fresh highlights
4+5 is high lift 1517 once fresh once the ash already washed out 
6 is my new roots 🤣😂🥲🥲🥲🥲

i appreciate all helpful tips ☺️
