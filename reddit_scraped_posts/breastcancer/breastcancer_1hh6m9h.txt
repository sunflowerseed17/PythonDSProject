Hi,
I’m driving from northern ca to Seattle with my partner and 5 year old son this coming weekend and would love family friendly audiobook suggestions!   

Update: thanks for all your great suggestions! We did the drive in two days and it was beautiful. I have a cold so we didn’t stop and do anything fun but are going to stop along the Oregon coast for 2 nights on the way back. We (I) loved the Wild Robot and mostly listened to that, but also started the bff. We’re going to finish them on way back.
