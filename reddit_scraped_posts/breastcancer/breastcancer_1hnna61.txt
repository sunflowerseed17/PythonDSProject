A year ago my life changed after a routine mammogram. I’m 44 so had only had a few. You never think about it, that there could be a chance. Especially since no one in my family had ever had it. Here we are a year later, lumpectomy, radiation, oopherectomy because I couldn’t take tamoxifen and now on an AI. Today I had my first mammogram since all this. I got into the room and started tearing up. Almost felt like I could have a panic attack and I was just so damn sad. I had been nervous leading up to this but wasn’t expecting to react this way. Especially since I’ve never really cried about it. Think I’ve been numb this whole year. The end of last year I had a stroke leading to a lupus diagnosis and lost my dad so I think I was numb when I got the cancer diagnosis. Has anybody else had a hard time getting a mammogram again. Does it get easier?
