I have my left side implant, my cancer side which was radiated and since I had the implant placed I have had an issue with seroma. My first implant was placed on October 31 and was drained between 35-50 ccs a week. PS decided to swap it out on December 12 thinking maybe there was a small infection that wasn't detected because I was on antibiotics. I went for my follow-up today and another 80 ccs was drained from my new implantâ€¦ it a about 4 weeks since surgery. Has this happened to anyone else? And how did it turn out??
