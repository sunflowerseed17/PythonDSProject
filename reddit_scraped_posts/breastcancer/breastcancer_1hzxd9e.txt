Quick history: 62 years old

Abnormal mammo in August 2024 (calcifications in right breast)

Additional mammo and ultrasound a few days later, ruled out lymph node involvement but recommended Needle biopsy, which I had late August 2024 (diagnosed atypical hyperplasia)

Agreed that I wanted the atypical hyperplasia surgically removed.

Excisional biopsy/lumpectomy October 28 (it took a long time because it was so "borderline" but was finally diagnosed DCIS grade 1...from what I understand ALL DCIS is stage 0...surgeon said he had to "take a lot out but got margins")

Met with medical oncologist January 6 who was shocked at the appearance of my breast (a plastic surgeon also said it was "severely deformed"). Had additional MRI and ultrasound on both breasts this past week (all clear). Have follow-up with medical oncologist January 16.

Have meeting scheduled with radiation oncologist February 4.

Based on all discussions so far, it sounds like they want me to have radiation and to go on Tamoxifen. 

I have no desire for mastectomy or reconstruction. Understand that I may eventually need mastectomy but will "go flat")

**Has anyone else had a severely deformed breast after lumpectomy? Experiences?**

After lots of reading I am iffy about whether I actually need radiation and after reading many of the posts here I see that some passed on radiation and then had a recurrence. I also understand that people tend to post when they have a bad experience and many many who have positive experiences do not.

I am not opposed to a mastectomy and have already decided against any kind of reconstruction.

**Would also love to hear from anyone who had DCIS grade 1 (already assuming stage 0 because all DCIS is stage 0) and lumpectomy but who passed on radiation when it was recommended and/or from anyone who's oncologist/radiation specialist told them they didn't need radiation and what was their rationale for you not needing it?**
