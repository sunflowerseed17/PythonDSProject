hi there, I'm new to this group and lurking for a while, but looking for information on managing TCHP chemo.  I (57F) was diagnosed with IDC, grade 2, stage 2, --+  in October and due to start chemo next week. I have been reading about TCHP experiences on this sub and many of them have been horrendous which has my anxiety spiraling.  My doctor had also offered me AC-T chemo but I understood that was an even harder chemo but after reading some of the experiences I don't even know what to think anymore.  Maybe AC-T is more tolerated than TCHP?  I'm also worried about the possible permanent hair loss on T which my oncologist has downplayed, but I'm going to try cold capping.  My mental state has been a mess since the diagnosis and I've already lost so much weight from anxiety so I'm not heading into chemo in the best head space or even physically so I'm looking for some assurances that TCHP is tolerable / manageable.  Help!
