This is not my normal self. I tend to panic and over-think the smallest stuff. And this is a freaking mastectomy. How am I not flipping out already? I don't know. Am I genuinely calm, or have I not fully grasped the reality of it? Iâ€™m terrified that I might try to back out at the last minute or pass out from the sheer anxiety of it all. This is supposed to be a big deal. First of all, I am going to lose a part of myself forever. Secondly, I don't even know if I will wake up from the surgery. Thirdly, the pain. Oh, the pain. Will I be able to go through it without wanting to kill myself? Only time will tell. And then there is always the anxiety of the pathology report. Cancer, the gift that keeps on giving. 

I don't want to go through this. I hate it with every fibre of my being. And yet, I can't wait to be done with this already. Ugh, horrible horrible cancer!!!
