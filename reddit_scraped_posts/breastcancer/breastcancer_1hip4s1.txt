I miss it so much!!! I loved my hair!

I’ve only got one round of dose dense Taxol left (finish Dec 30th). I realized this means I’ll be back to work soon and suddenly I’m so self-conscious about my bald freaking head.

I mean it’s got some peach fuzz now but that somehow makes me feel worse!

I have such tiny ears, wtf… They look so bizarre! I never noticed before.

I kept my eyebrows and eyelashes. I should feel lucky. My eyebrows look UNRULY though so now I have to learn how to tame that… They were always covered by my bangs. I feel overwhelmed by this.

I hate hats! Even the thin ones make me so hot indoors. But I can’t “rock the bald”. I hate it. I work in a school and am dreading being asked about it 700 times a day by the sweet, well-meaning kiddos.

But the worst part is thinking about how I hate short hair. I once got a bob, chin-length and had instant regret. My hair looks best no shorter than my shoulders. That’s probably 12-14 inches of growth. I read that the average growth in a year is 6 inches. So, about two years until I have hair I like again?

TWO YEARS until I feel myself? I’m sobbing. Of course I’ll trade my hair to live, but it’s really freaking unfair. 

The body dysmorphia is so real. I can’t stand people telling me “you are rocking it”! I’m not! I’M NOT!! I’m just left with no choice but to exist in this way.
