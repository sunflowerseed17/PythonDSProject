Diagnosed October, first treatment plan was dmx with reconstruction December 13. Today was my first post op visit. My non cancer breast is becoming necrosis and now they’re doing an emergency surgery tomorrow to remove both implants. I’ll be going flat until after all treatment is done. And was just told the two lymph nodes removed have isolated cancer cells or something like that. Idk what all that means and I guess I’ll wait to speak to the oncologist. They just now referred me to one. I feel defeated. Completely defeated.
