So I was spinning here about my full body CT for stage 1a Her2+ tumor. I got the results and the doctor said “no metastasis”. The CT found 1) thyroid nodules that I already monitor for 3 years and biopsied as benign, 2) some lesion in the liver which is likely benign. He didn’t seem concerned and said we can do an MRI later. I of course fixated on this but then finally read my path reports from both hospitals and the tumor is described as primarily in the duct (because it grew from DCIS), no nodes, no LVI. Also my tumor markers, which were already within normal range before surgery, have dropped by half after. Given this and the fact that the radiologist didn’t clearly flag the lesion, it’s probably not very likely to be related to BC. So on to adjuvant TH in 2 weeks.
