I was diagnosed ++- stage 2 IDC in Nov 2023 with 1 lymph node positive. BMX with clean margins and 6 clean nodes, 33 rounds of radiation and now I take verzenio, arimidex, and a monthly lupron shot. I'm 41, so premenopausal at diagnosis. I paused my verzenio recently for my implant swap and my joint pain is through the roof. I'm overweight (working on that), so aches and pains are not a new thing for me. But, this is near debilitating. I can't sleep. It hurts to walk. And a new thing after surgery is pain and numbness in my fingers and feet.

My dad has RA. I'm worried that I do, too. Love my mom and dad, but man did I get the shit end of the gene stick (mom had BC over 20 years ago). 

I have an appointment with my PCP next week and plan to discuss this with my MO when I see her next.

I'm just wondering if anyone has experience with joint pain on hormone meds or experience with RA and breast cancer. How can I tell the difference between normal arthritis and RA? What questions should I ask my doctor?

Thanks!

Edited to fix my age. Am 41 now, going on 107 apparently.
