I’m having horrible menopause symptoms after being forced to remove my estradiol patch after getting breast cancer. My oncologist recommended using Midi Health, some kind of menopause “platform.” 

I got scammed by one of these kinds of “platforms“ for a different health condition before. Is Midi Health legit or also a scam?
