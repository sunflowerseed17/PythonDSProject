Hi all! 

So my first Signatera test (April/May) was a positive of 5.08 and 2 lung nodules were found and were confirmed to be the TNBC. After starting a new treatment the nodules shrunk by more than half and my Signatera test was negative (September). I had a Signatera test at the end of October that was positive of 3.78. My white blood cells were a little high that day and the nurse practitioner said it could be a false positive due to inflammation etc. And that the scan would give more info. I did another Signatera test 10 days ago, 5 weeks after the last one and it was positive of 307. The day I did the test, I had a bad cold and could not stop coughing. My white blood cells were like 21 and my neutrophils were like 16, so both were incredibly high. 

I feel like to go from 3.78 to 307 in 5 weeks is incredibly fast and seems like it has to be false. I have a PET scan scheduled for Monday, but I can't stop thinking about the Signatera results. Has anyone had a false positive Signatera test due to being sick or just a false positive in general?

So far I have only heard of one person having false positive results and she had a wild journey! After multiple positive tests, they changed it and said it was actually negative. 

Thank you!!!

EDIT: I am still in active treatment, so it seems odd that it would increase that much in a short period of time.

UPDATE: I am providing an update just in case some one comes across this in the future and is in the same position. I got the results of my scan, and my cancer has progressed. It looks like one nodule may be gone but the other one that shrunk to 9mm is now measuring 7.5 x 6.3 x 6.7 cm.
