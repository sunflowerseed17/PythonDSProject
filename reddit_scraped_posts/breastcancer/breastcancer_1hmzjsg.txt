I got my phone call today from my biopsy last Friday.  I have cancer in both breasts.  They are ordering an MRI to see the extent of it.  I have an appointment with the oncologist on Monday to go over the biopsy results, type of cancer, and discuss treatment options.  

This sub has been so helpful.  I love the fact that a question can be asked multiple times from different people and its always answered politely.  I hate the fact I had to look this place up, but I will forever be grateful for the information and support I found here.

If you are new here, I highly recommend if you have a question, just ask.  If you have fears, just write it out.  Someone here will have you!

Best wishes for all y'all!!
