35F diagnosed with stage 3 IDC with central necrosis, ++-. Last imaging done had 12 lesions including 4 obvious tumors. Tumors have grown significantly since then and lymph nodes are now very swollen.

2 tumors and 1 lymph node biopsied in December and we have another biopsy scheduled on January 22nd. The treatment plan (or rather the order of treatment) is still not finalized and we’re trying to squeeze in egg retrieval.

I just received the blood testing that showed my AMH at 75.4pmol. Classic PCOS. ultrasound scheduled for next week to see what the cysts currently look like.

I’ve been able to keep my anxiety somewhat controlled but it really has hit me like a truck today. I will be seeing the medical oncologist on Tuesday for about 2 hours and hoping to get more answers.

At my last appointment with the surgeon, lumpectomy is now off the table and we’re now looking at SMX, potentially BMX depending on what the pet scan and genetic testing shows. 

Dr. Google doesn’t give a lot of optimism for IDC with central necrosis. 

Any suggestions for how to manage chemo and surgery recovery with a toddler?

Any insight on egg retrieval with high AMH levels?

Any insight on whether or not there are differences with central necrosis?

Any insight on reconstruction? I was hoping to do reconstruction with my own tissues but I’m worried I don’t have enough for reconstruction if we end up doing BMX.
