Hey y'all I just had a double mastectomy and DIEP flap reconstruction on 12/2.  I've been using the hospital issued binder faithfully and still have 3/4 drains in.  I just saw that the handout from my plastic surgeon says that when my abdominal drains come out I can switch to a panty girdle? I imagine they don't just mean Spanx but I honestly don't know!  Any recommendations are welcome, thank you!
