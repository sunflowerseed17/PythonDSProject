In the scheme of things to come this feels really really stupid.

But I just had a blood test (before port insertion).

And the nurse was all chirpy about the veins on my hand being a back up place if the veins in my arm were hard to find. 

I was ok then but I can't stop crying since I got home. I don't want to be a human pin cushion. I don't want to be sliced and diced and pumped full of poison. And I really don't want to feel like my body parts are just specimens that people are excited about because they're easier to poke holes in.

 I have to go back Monday for the pre chemo bloods . Fuck.
