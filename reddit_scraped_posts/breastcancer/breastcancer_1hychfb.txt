Has anyone had a port installed?  If I decide to do a single mastectomy would I have to have a port installed.  I don't think so what with the cancers removed.

For those that have had a single mastectomy did you have an implant put in?  I'm not really endowed so that's a plus.

Thanks for your patience.
