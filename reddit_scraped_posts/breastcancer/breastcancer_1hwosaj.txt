I just got a call from my pharmacy saying the manufacturer of Tamoxifen keeps pushing back delivery dates and that they donâ€™t have any remaining in their inventory. I was advised to drive around to different pharmacies in the area to see if those other pharmacies had any left in their physical reserves. Has anyone else run into this?
