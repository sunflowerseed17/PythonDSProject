I will be doing PT at home - I know it's not ideal - it's my only option and the only question I am hoping for some answers to is:

Did you do anything that brought immediate relief to the pain? I've been told no ice/no heat and I just want to know did you do anything - a cream? an exercise that helped you feel some immediate relief?
