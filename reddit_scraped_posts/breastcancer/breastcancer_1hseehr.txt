I suffer from severe anxiety and just when I thought I had turned a corner - my labs triggered me. I was dx'ed with DCIS in June. I had a lumpectomy the beginning of Sept,  reduction and lift end of Sept, and finished rads mid Nov. I was supposed to start baby Tam, but oncologist feels the cons outweigh the pros especially considering the current state of my mental health.

My wbc has always been in the 4-6 range. It was 3.7 in July (one month after diagnosis). Three weeks ago it came back 2.9. I just had it retested and it went up to 3.1, but lymphocytes went from .78 (three weeks ago) down to .67, and I'm losing my mind over it. Anyone experience this ?

My medical oncologist and hematologist don't seem worried, but I am.The constant feeling of "What's wrong now" is just so exhausting...

Edited to shorten and correct error of referring to neutrophils instead of lymphocytes.
