Anyone dealing with a headache?  I had my first treatment of ddAC and I had fallen asleep during it only to wake up 5 min before the ‘C’ finished by aspirating.  I woke up coughing and my eyes were blurry and a killer headache.  
The headache is still here on day 3 and the doctor thinks it’s from the steroid they gave me. 
The headache woke me up early this morning and I feel we will have another day of this.
I have taken all the pills but no relief yet. 

Anyone else have this and what did you do for it?
