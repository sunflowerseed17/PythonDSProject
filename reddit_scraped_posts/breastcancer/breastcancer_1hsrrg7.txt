Got this super cozy fleece from the men’s section of Kohls and it has an internal pocket! I’ve been wearing it for weeks and just realized! I wish I would’ve realized this when I still had my drain in but knew I needed to share it with all of you. Hope those of you with an upcoming surgery consider this fleece. https://www.kohls.com/product/prd-6824241/mens-sonoma-goods-for-life-arctic-fleece-shirt-jacket.jsp
