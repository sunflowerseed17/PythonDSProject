I had a surgical removal of grade 1 stage 1 bc on my right breast Jan 2024. In late November I went for a follow-up oncologist appt and she said I was in remission after checking both my breasts. I went for routine mm 30/12 and they found abnormality. Went back today for 3D mm, ultrasound and biopsy and the sonographer said biopsy was needed cos she saw it was a solid mass. How could the oncologist miss a lump which could be shown on imagining just a month later? Or was it something really aggressive that has grown quickly within a month?
