I have diagnosed DCIS in the left breast and 2 diagnosed breast cancers in the right breast 10:00 7 cm from the nipple and 1 cm from the nipple -- both liminal, grade 2 Her2 negative. One is 1.3 cans and one is 1.9 cans. They called me to let me know my breast MRI has upgraded those to 22nd and 3cm and also detected what look like invasive breast cancer between the two masses. In addition, they found another area of possible  DCIS in the left breast and  2 or 3 other smaller masses in the right that must be biopsied. I feel like this is never going to end!!! I suggested just having a double mastectomy and getting rid of everything. My thinking is that no more biopsies will be needed in this case? Has anyone had a similar situation? I am very stressed and can't even think of anything help. I would appreciate any feedback.
