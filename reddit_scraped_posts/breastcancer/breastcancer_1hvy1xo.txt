Hello! Quick post to share my success with running two humidifiers in my house 24-7 (while I am home) during chemo. I am 10/12 done with weekly Taxol infusions. At the start of chemo, dry skin, eyes and nostrils were a big issue for me. I was moisturizing skin, eyes, nostrils constantly but still uncomfortable all the time. Since I started running two humidifiers in the house at all times, my skin and eyes don't even really require moisturizer. I found a great aloe gel for my nostrils but the humidifier helped them a lot as well.

I have been drinking 10-12 cups of fluids daily since the start of chemo. Humidifiers cannot replace drinking copious fluids. However, they have made a huge difference in my tolerance of chemo.

Thank you to this community for sharing your wisdom. I hope my experience can be useful to some of you!
