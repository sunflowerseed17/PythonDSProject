I know they'll lighten up some, but I just want some opinions...

I had them done 12/13 and touched up this past Friday (1/6). I got them done because I'll be starting chemo on Thursday, and will be losing my hair.

I'm wondering if that's why she made them (imo) more severe than the initial application? I also feel like they space betweenI my brows seems off center now.

1st photo is right before I went in for my touch up, 2nd is today in sunlight, 3rd and 4th are as I'm writing this post (with flash), 5th is natural brows post-swim, 6th is natural (freshly tinted) brows, 7th is the day of initial application.

Sorry for the weird photo order and awkward angles ðŸ˜­

Also, if they look bad please tell me...don't spare my feelings!
