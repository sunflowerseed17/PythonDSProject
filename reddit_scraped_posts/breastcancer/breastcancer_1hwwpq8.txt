hi friends- we made the decision to stop my zoloft on friday before kadcyla since it was giving me such terrible GI upset. i gave it a good 4 month trial. i am someone who definitely needs to be on an antidepressant, but i donâ€™t find SSRIs have worked *great* for me. looking for the perfect fit is soooo frustrating. 
what are some tamoxifen-friendly antidepressants that have worked for yall?
