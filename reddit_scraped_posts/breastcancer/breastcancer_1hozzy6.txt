Hello! Did some searches and haven't seen discussion of using whole body cryotherapy chambers during chemo to help with side effects and recovery. Anyone have firsthand experience, what it was like, did it help? 

I've done it once before chemo and know there's a lot of good solid evidence for its benefits. And localized cryo like icing hands and feet to fight neuropathy works, and scalp cooling for hair loss. 

Feeling chemo shit days now and wondering if dragging myself to a nearby cryo chamber place will help me bounce back.
