So now we all know that Denise has been lying, and Ouisa supposedly has not been filling any vials but instead outsourcing them to other 503b pharmacies. BUT the Ouisa label is slapped on every vial with Ouisa dosing instructions. 
Has anyone had issues with dosing? 503b pharm 1 might have different dosing than 503b pharm 2, but Ouisa made them all look alike. 
Aside from my anger at what they've done, I'm wondering if anyone has had issues with the included Ouisa instructions for dosage.
