I’ve been on parental leave with our baby since October. I got this delightful little surprise diagnosis less than a month into my leave time. The plan all along has been that the baby would start daycare and I’d go back to work in the new year when my FMLA time was up…but now that it’s all happening while I’m approaching round 3 of TCHP I’m dreading pretty much everything about going back. I love my job and the people I work with, and my boss has been incredibly supportive and is giving me flexibility with assigned tasks and remote work as needed. And I should be able to take disability leave if need be too, though with less pay. I know I have a lot going for me and should be grateful for it. But it still just sucks. And I’m so frustrated with the American system of giving you roughly five minutes of leave time that you can spend on either baby bonding or illness, just don’t dare to have both of those things happen to you within the same twelve-month period.

Not looking for advice or solutions, though encouragement/solidarity is totally welcome. Just needed to vent.
