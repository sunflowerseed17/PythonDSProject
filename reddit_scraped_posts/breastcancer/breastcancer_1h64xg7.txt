Sorry friends this is a rant and I just need to vent to ppl who under. I had my third infusion of immuno, cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin (TNBC) Friday and its Tuesday and i am soo tired. I have my almost 12 month old running around but my mom was here along with nanny and I'm STILL tired! 

I've been lucky with side effects but I'm mentally done.. we've had a couple more cancer scenarios come up in my extended family- not necessarily breast but somehow I have become the cancer expert? I don't mind helping the ppl I love deal with this unexpected time with their loved ones, I have a medical background and it seems to help but yesterday after 2 different ppl messages me about either cancer or autoimmune, I politely told them I will speak to them later.  

Anyways, thank you for listening while I get into bed.. at 6pm.
