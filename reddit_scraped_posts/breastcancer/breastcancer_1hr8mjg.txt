Isnâ€™t it crazy how he was born sheltered and taken care of by humans, but still knows that predators are predators and is super vigilant to danger? He immediately notices a hawk flying by outside the window and gets into this stance + screams like an alarm. He only gets like this is he sees anything that would be a potential predator or threat (humans, hawks, raccoons, etc). He doesnâ€™t relax until the predator is gone even though heâ€™s fully inside the house and safe. He is so smart!! ðŸ’›
