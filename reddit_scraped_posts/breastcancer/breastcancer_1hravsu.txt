I have 6 rounds of TCH for IDC, and I have been experiencing debilitating migraines. My chemotherapy doctor said it’s not a side effect of chemotherapy, but I’ve read on Reddit that people describe similar pain. I’ve also googled it, and it says migraines can be a side effect. 

I drink a lot of water and have started adding electrolytes, but it’s still not helping. 

I know it could be hormones , My periods have always been heavy, so I use the Merula XL, which holds 50 ml, and since i started chemotherapy I fill it up every hour for three days in a row. My doctor says this is normal, but everything I read online states that 80 ml in one period is considered heavy, and I’m way beyond that. Nothing helps with this pain. Has anyone had a similar experience, and what did you do to relieve it?
