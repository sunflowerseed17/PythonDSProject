Even with stage 1a breast cancer, the doctor wants me to torture myself with an aromatase inhibitors for five years even though the absolute risk reduction will be only 2% to 3%. I already have all of the diseases that the aromatase inhibitors can cause and exacerbate. I currently have only osteopenia, and I absolutely do not want to get osteoporosis.

It seems like the treatment for this early-stage cancer is endless. I know two people who had colon cancer, and all they had to do was have surgery to remove the cancerous section of the colon! They didnâ€™t have to have radiation or chemotherapy. 

I know many men with metastatic prostate cancer who just had radiation and 18 months of hormone blockers. 

My dad, who had prostate cancer that metastasized to five lymph nodes, did not have to have any lymph nodes removed! They diagnosed them via nuclear medicine. Why do we breast cancer patients have to suffer with incredibly painful and potentially debilitating lymph node removal?

Why is the treatment for early-stage breast cancer so brutal and long-term in comparison to these other cancers?
