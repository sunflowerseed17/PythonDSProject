sorry to post again …
but i just had my second zoladex shot and while the first one was so painful - not the insering of the needle but the needle snapping back in and my doctor didnt know this would happen!- the one now i almost didnt feel it… it also didnt make the loud click it made the first time.
i was like ‚what? i didnt almost feel it‘ and my doc said he tried to give his best since the last one hurt…
or could something went wrong?
