Hey all ðŸ‘‹

I wanted to put in a kind word for Pink Ribbon Good organization. They provide free meals, as well as free rides for treatments, organic housecleaning supplies, free vacuum cleaner, as well as virtual and in person opportunities for the community to get together. I couldnâ€™t have survived this year without their free rides, since I live alone. Those rides were probably worth at least $3K by themselves, as Uber is quite expensive! 

To show my appreciation, I have made a donation to PRG. If youâ€™re looking for an organization to donate to, please consider PRG, and spread the word!
