I currently have a tissue expander after getting a mastectomy on my right side, and future plans are to eventually get an implant. I know this is covered by insurance by law, however, if i wanted to also get an implant on my left side (no cancer or mastectomy done) to match up the sizes, would this still be covered or would it be out of pocket falling under another category?  Wondering if anyone has had this situation and/or know about it.  

Per the WHCRA law, it states “Surgery and reconstruction of the other breast to produce a symmetrical appearance” is covered but I guess I am an over thinker..
