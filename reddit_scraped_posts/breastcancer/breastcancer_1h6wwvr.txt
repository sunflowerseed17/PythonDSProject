Hello all, tomorrow is the day. 
I’m having my DMX with expanders placed tomorrow. 

I’ve done as much prep as I possibly could. The pillows, the button downs, prepping my sleeping situation, and I installed the bidet. (I actually love it & I will be keeping it.) 

It’s been since April that I’ve been thinking about this surgery. I don’t think anything really prepares you mentally. I’ve definitely come a long way since then. 

The past few weeks I’ve felt very depressed. Now that the surgery’s tomorrow for some reason it has subsided. I feel although I have accepted the worst and I’m just hoping that the outcome will be a little better than what I’m expecting.  

It’s so unfair, I want to back out. I know someday I will be okay, but getting there is going to be a rough road. 

Im only 23, chemo was very difficult and I’m awaiting the after effects. This surgery is just something different. I’ll never be the same and I understand that. Grasping that is just hard. I can only hope that they look nice through clothing one day. 

I feel for every woman that has gone through this & I know that you all feel for me. thank you to everyone in this reddit. You have given me so much information and have helped me prep. 

I hope one day I will be okay. I hope one day my tits will be semi nice. I hope one day medicine will advance and women in the future won’t have to go through this. 

I HOPE I WILL BE CANCER FREE AFTER THE CHOP.
