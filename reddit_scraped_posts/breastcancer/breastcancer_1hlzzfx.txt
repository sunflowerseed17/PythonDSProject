I was just diagnosed four years ago and I am currently in remission though I have bone metastasis so I always have that pain.  My first Christmas with cancer all my hair fell out on Christmas Day and it just seems like my ability to do anything is getting professedly worse. I tried to make a pie for Christmas and blew it up twice. I’m staying here and nursing the burns on my hands. Just really disappointed in myself.
