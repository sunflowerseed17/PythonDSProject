This is a breeding patch for green mums. Seed yellow and white. All the yellow, purple, and green were grown directly from those three seed flowers. 

I had recently removed most flowers from my island, and zero remaining flowers were these colors (I had white mums 20ish squares away). 

How did it throw red? I canâ€™t figure it out.
