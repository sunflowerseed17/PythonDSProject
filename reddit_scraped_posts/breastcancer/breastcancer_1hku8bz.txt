Hello,

  I could use some help. When I first met with my breast surgeon I did genetic testing to determine which surgery would be most appropriate. Three months later right before Christmas they let me know I am on the hook for the 3k bill because it is considered experimental or investigational. For reference I have Blue Cross Blue Shield Federal Employee Program insurance, did anyone successfully appeal this decision? Thank you.
