I'm just over 2 weeks into this (stage 2 tnbc, start chemo in the new year). 

I am NOT going on a journey (my life is not a disney movie) and I don't think war analogies will help make this more tolerable for me at all. (I have a lot of fear, feeling pressure to feel up to a fight or else it won't work. )

I need a way to think about doing this that lets me be vulnerable and messy and stuck if I need to be. I have agency, but not control. 

Everything I can think of right now feels very bleak - like earthquakes or tsunamis.

Any ideas?
