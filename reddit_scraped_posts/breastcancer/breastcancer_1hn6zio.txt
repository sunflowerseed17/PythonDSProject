Long shot but has anyone suffered keloids prior to mastectomy? I’m 41 and am going in for single mastectomy Jan 10. My chest is covered in large keloids that began spontaneously at puberty and grew exponentially during my two pregnancies. I have known for a long time that they were responding to hormones as the nerve pain is worst during my luteal phase. I see a skin specialist for co2 lasers to suppress the keloids which helps with sensitivity and pain somewhat.

Now this breast cancer is hormone responsive too I’m so curious about a systemic issue with my hormone production/uptake. I’m not sure what my question is. I’m looking for anyone who has experience with keloids and breast cancer. Feeling like this body of mine is on self-destruct mode 😮‍💨
