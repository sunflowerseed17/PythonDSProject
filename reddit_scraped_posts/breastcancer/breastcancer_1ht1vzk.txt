I’m in utter terror from reading about 2 women with Her2+ that were stage 1 (about 1.5-2 cm tumors, negative lymph nodes) but further testing discovered they already had mets because it spread through the blood.

I went from extensive DCIS to stage 1a after SMX, 1.6 cm tumor, negative sentinel node, ER-PR-Her2+, ki67 of 28%. I’m scheduled to start Taxol-Herceptin end of the month but because of changing to a different hospital they ordered a full body CT as a baseline (also because I’m in Japan and they love scanning). I’ll hear my results next week and I’m frozen in fear. 

All my doctors act like I’m a low-risk case because the tumor is already out, clear margins and negative nodes, pre-surgical chest CT was good. When I bring up spread through the blood they look at me funny but there are these horror cases so it’s not impossible. I’m spiraling.
