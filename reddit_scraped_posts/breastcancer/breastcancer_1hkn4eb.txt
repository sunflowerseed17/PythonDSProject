Hi everyone, Iâ€™m currently on Day 5 of my first round of AC chemo and thank goodness I donâ€™t have to take the steroids anymore but I still feel off. Like I still canâ€™t focus doing normal activities nor do I feel like I want to do them even if I have to like grocery shopping.

How do you do it? Iâ€™m sluggish at the moment, but Iâ€™m happy to not be hyped up first thing in the morning. I try to get the roids out of the way early I was given dexamethasone because it drives me crazy and not in a way I want to clean everything kind of way either.

Should I ask for another type of steroid next chemo day? How can I keep a little bit of focus to do things I have to just one thing.? Thank you for any advice out there ðŸ¥¹
