I just got my diagnosis, advanced IBC. I have a week until I meet with my care team. 

I have two little girls playing around me at the moment. I feel like Iâ€™m going to be sick. 

How do I function until this settles in a little? Is it common to be given anti anxiety meds? I could really use a heavy sedative right now.
