Hello, 

I was originally decided on AFC, but my breast surgeon mentioned O-FAFF.  
It is less invasive and less recovery time compared to other type of fat/tissue reconstruction.

I am ok going flat, but having breast would be nice too.

I am mostly concerned about recovery time, the additional risks, and if it needs corrective surgery in the future.

Has anyone considered these two options, and what did you decide? What was the reason for your decision?

Thank you.
