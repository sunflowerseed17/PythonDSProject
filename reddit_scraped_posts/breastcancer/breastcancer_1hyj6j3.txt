Just when you think things are going to be okay.  In Jan 2024 I was diagnosed with a malignant nodular melanoma.  FEB i was supposed to get a Mammogram, but was sidelined due to having a Wide Excision and bilateral sentinel node biopsies (the melanoma area drained into both armpits from my upper back.  Fortunately the nodes were clear and so started my watch and wait for recurrence. 
     So, I get a rescheduled mammogram in September   2024 and WTF, I’m diagnosed with breast cancer, Stage 1 ++-.  Just finished Radiation for that and had an appointment this last Wednesday with my oncologist to start AI’s .  I showed her a tender lump near my armpit on my chest wall.  She says it’s either cording, or a metastasis of maybe the breast cancer, but more likely the melanoma. And orders a stat ultrasound. I had not heard from the scheduling department today so I called asking when my appointment might be.  Oh, they had the order but hadn’t gotten around to calling me yet.  Seriously!  Two days after a stat order?  So the first available app is Jan 16… 8 days for a stat order.  The scheduler got her supervisor to see if I could get in sooner, but nope, that’s it.  Now I’m stuck in waiting hell till next Thursday.  Do you think I should complain to the hospital that a stat order took so long? I’m so frustrated.
