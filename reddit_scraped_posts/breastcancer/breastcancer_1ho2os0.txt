Update 31/12
From the bottom of my heart I want to thank every one of you who took the time to respond to this scared stranger in Ireland. I have found myself reading your comments over and over again. I reached out for help yesterday and got some Xanax in the meantime. The support counselor should be back at work Thursday so only a couple of days to navigate. I feel a bit better sometimes and then I’m back down in the hole. 
Just to update on the type I have…the report says invasive Ductal Carcinoma (No Special Type). ER+ PR+ Her2- (I’m petrified to google any of this) 

I am so afraid of not beating this. I love my husband, my family and my simple life so much. I really wanted to grow old.

I can barely see the screen through all the tears. 38, Recently diagnosed, I don’t know exact type yet. There’s one node involved - all bone & CT scans are clear. I’m doing dose dense AC-T which I started on the 23rd Dec. I am not coping at all. I keep thinking I would be better off dead now. All the support numbers they gave me are closed for the Christmas. I have my husband and family for support but it’s not fair on them having to put up with me. I can’t get away from it, I hate waking up - still being here. Still having cancer. I am scared, I am lost and I don’t know what to do.
