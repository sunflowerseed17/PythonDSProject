Age 40s single woman flying solo in her Tamoxifen era. DX was in February. Here to close out the worst year of my life; NYE I’ll also be alone. 

Anyone care to share changes they’ll be making? Today I called my ex turned friend (we broke up 5 years ago) to tell him about a failed situation with someone I like very much romantically and am sad about, and his response is “I told you to fix your teeth.” In 2025, I’m done with all toxic men, esp exes who act like I’m not “attractive enough” bcuz I didn’t do cosmetic procedures but 100 percent of the time we hang out they will try to sleep with me. This was my same friend who judged me for having a GoFundMe after going bankrupt from cancer treatment “why don’t you just get a 2nd job?” He also won’t let me talk about feeling sad, depressed, anxious or broke from cancer shit bcuz that’s “being negative and negative talk creates more negativity.” This is just his attempt to silence me; I won't be silenced. In fact, I am writing a book about my experiences with pre-cervical cancer and breast cancer and all the stigma surrounding them both. Way too much stigma concerning women's health...

Done with gross and lazy men. Had a first date the other night, we went on to a coffee shop the other night, we talked for literally 5 hours and he didn’t even offer to buy me a cup of coffee, just sat drinking coffee he got for himself. Then 2 days later asks for a home visit for the second date. Sir, I’ve known you for less than 48 hours; and if you can’t afford coffee, how can you afford popcorn? 

I’m onto my first gummy here shortly; I’m tired of thinking so damn much about the Man I wanted to be with, being broke bcuz just cancer shit, being alone, insomnia, my low paying job, and more….
