I posted here a couple of weeks ago linking my recent 3-month window of absolute bliss to adrenaline/stress. After the window ended I went into a terrible wave. Someone asked me if I was taking any new medication that could be behind the window and I kind of dismissed it. However, after going through the timeline I realized that the window completely coincided with regular Ambien use to cope with my cancer anxiety insomnia.

Since this realization, I tested GABA agonists (Ambien during the night, Xanax during the day - not concurrently!) and I have to say, stimulating these receptors definitely gives me higher libido, arousal response and sensitivity. Given that my major crash came after overdosing ginkgo (a mild GABA antagonist), I’m now back to a theory that at the root of my PSSD is a GABA system dysregulation. Since benzos are not a sustainable patch, I’m planning to test other ways of rebalancing this system.
