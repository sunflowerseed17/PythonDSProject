My parents are worried. I get it. They are also in their eighties which means they tend to ask the same question in consecutive phone calls. This is early days for me. Recovering from lumpectomy and haven’t met medonc yet. I cannot have so many phone calls about me and cancer. I need a break and I am not sure they get it. I told them I don’t want to talk about this every conversation. The response was- yes, you do seem to get upset. Ugh. Boundary setting advice welcome.
