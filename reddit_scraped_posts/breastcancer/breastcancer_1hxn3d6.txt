I had surgery back in December and based on pathology results I am due to meet with a radiation and medical oncologist next week, odds are I will need chemo even without a known oncotype score.

My issue is that at the location closest to me (about 30 mins) the two medical oncos my surgeon recommended aren't taking new patients. That only leaves one doctor to go with and to put it simply it seems they are fairly newer to the field and with less listed experience. I figure that they are working at that location (a fairly prestigious hospital) for a reason, and the patient reviews I see are all good, but I can't help but be annoyed by a lack of choice in the matter.

My alternative would be to go to the location where I had surgery (same hospital system but an hour away) but all the docs there are booked until Feb, and that would put me at 7-8 weeks post surgery just for a consult, and my understanding is chemo should have started by then...

Any words of reassurance? And can anyone suggest questions I should ask during the first meeting?
