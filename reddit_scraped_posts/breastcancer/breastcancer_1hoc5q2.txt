I’ve hit rock bottom with self esteem and confidence through this whole experience. Diagnosed with her2+/hormone negative back in April. Spent the summer going through chemo, mastectomy in September, followed by more chemo since I didn’t achieve pcr. Lost all my hair during this second round. Started kadcyla this week and have a full year of treatments ahead. I was able to keep a positive attitude through most of this, I was the one reassuring family members that everyone will work out. I’ve now hit an emotional wall, I am uncomfortable in my body, I don’t feel like ever leaving my house, and I’m struggling as a young mom with a toddler who has no idea what is going on. It’s also a difficult time of year with short days, cold/rainy weather, and not much to do (I live in New England). Any suggestions on small changes I can make to help get back to feeling myself again? I know it won’t happen overnight but I want to go into the new year with a plan and a positive outlook. I work full time but am able to work from home so I don’t have a ton of time on my hands.
