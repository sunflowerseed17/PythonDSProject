The last few years have been an insane lot. 

I was rediagnosed with ADHD in late 2021. It took until mid-late 2022 to get the meds situated. By then my marriage was falling apart. Anxiety became a big issue, especially after the divorce was initiated in March 2023. I ended up having to be put on anxiety meds. I traveled for work from Oct 2023-March 2024. The divorce finally started making headway after then, but right at the tail end of that, I got diagnosed with cancer. I got my diagnosis on a Tuesday, divorce got its final Decree on that Wednesday. I had my first chemo treatment, 2 days later the divorce finalized.

I've been struggling with loneliness and a huge bit of melancholy for a while. I end up spiraling down and getting into my head when that happens. It feels like mood swings at times, something I don't remember experiencing much of in the past. Like today. Work kept me busy and I ended up bringing stuff home. I was texting with friends, working, and in a generally good mood. Then I stopped to cook dinner and have somehow plummeted into loneliness and into my head. I have no want to finish what I was working on, no want to really do anything. 

In the morning, I have a call with my psychologist, who handles my anxiety. Like multiple times before, I want to ask about possible depression. Situational, seasonal, I'm not really sure. I just can't seem to start that conversation with him. I think I talk myself out of it and it's actual possibility of being real. But something has to give. 

If you have any suggestions or thoughts to share, I would appreciate it.
