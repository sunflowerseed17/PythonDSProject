In case anyone wants extra knowledge support on their journey, I recommend using this service: [https://www.mycancernavigator.org/en](https://www.mycancernavigator.org/en)  
  
It's completely FREE. You basically write about your diagnosis, they schedule a video call where you describe your clinical history and ask any questions you have. You can upload your documentation to the website (scan results, path reports). They take a couple of weeks and then come back to you with evidence-based answers after talking to oncologists in their network, reviewing the literature etc. No question is too weird. I asked about my planned therapy etc but also about the benefits of keto diet for breast cancer and they provided published papers on this topic and recommendations (basically no strong evidence there).
