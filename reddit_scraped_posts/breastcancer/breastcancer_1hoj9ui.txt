I had my last AC infusion two days ago and am feeling like complete garbage today. It has been similar every round but somehow this time seems worse with nausea and exhaustion. Now I have 11 days until my first taxol infusion and I am terrified. I donâ€™t think I can go through the side effects for another 12 weeks. Would love reassurances that taxol is easier.
