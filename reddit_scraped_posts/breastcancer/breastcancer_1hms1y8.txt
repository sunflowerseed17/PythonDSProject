Christmas hit harder than I expected it to this year. I just started kadcyla on Monday, the day before Christmas Eve so I was very tired for the holiday. We had a smallish gathering and I was in my beanie because I’m still uncomfortable with the way I look but I can’t stand wearing a wig. It felt like everyone was looking at me feeling bad and while I understand it was not meant to be hurtful but I just wanted a normal holiday. I have one relative who cries every time my cancer is even brought up, and I can’t control other people’s emotions but it bothers me because I am not crying, so why are you? It just feels a little bit like making my disease about it yourself when what I really need right now is strength and good energy, not sad looks and tears. Anyone else have a difficult holiday?
