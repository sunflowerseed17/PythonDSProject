If there is a way to do this, could someone point me in the right direction? I've tried to figure it out on my own, but I have not been successful.  

Edit: I do have, in my filters, to exclude titles that contain the word meme, but it isn't working like I expect it to: I still get meme posts.  

Thanks!
