I realize that the law requires insurance companies to pay for reconstruction, but my questions are a bit more detailed. Please let me know if anyone has experience or knows about the following:

~Do you have to meet your deductible or out of pocket max for the year before coverage kicks in? (I maxed this year due to DMX and radiation, but I'm curious what happens in 2025 when insurance resets and I start moving toward reconstruction.)

~Can you pick any plastic surgeon and be covered? Or do you have to stick with physicians who are in your network?


EDIT: I think where I'm getting tripped up is the notion of "coverage." Insurance coverage means they can't deny your right to reconstruction, but coverage doesn't mean it's a free procedure or that you can pick any ol' physician right? And this also applies to revisions over time?
