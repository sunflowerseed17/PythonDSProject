The biopsy was Wednesday. I have read breezy accounts of ultrasound biopsies here—mine was not. Bodies are different, of course, and nerves are weird… So, it started smoothly: I shoved my slight needle phobia deep down and they collected three samples. During the fourth, I felt pain. Felt like, all blood left my head, replaced with sweat and heat pouring from my face, also panting—definitely would’ve passed out if I hadn’t been horizontal. They could tell immediately something was wrong, stopped and pumped more lidocaine into my breast and I recovered shortly after. They decided not to take more samples and placed the clip. 
For me: could have been my minor lidocaine desensitivity (redhead) or they hit upon a particular nerve somewhere in there. 
I also can’t say for sure how intense the pain actually was. Needle phobia: I have a history of fainting at the sight of needles and blood. I manage this by focusing on breathing and not looking and I can get very calm and stoic. But I have gotten knocked off my calm, which results in bodily panic and fainting. Feeling the beginning of pain deep in my breast may have triggered that. 
Here’s good things: the technicians and doctor were super kind. They made it very clear from the start that they did not want me to feel pain beyond the lidocaine shots. They apologized repeatedly for my experience and showed compassion. All 3 were women :)
SO glad I took the day off of work. My brain was mush after all that. The icing was great. No major pain but I am still feeling aches and twinges. 
And it was still better than the stereotactic biopsy from a few years ago.
