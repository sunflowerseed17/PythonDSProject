Hey, I'm in a town with many amenities but fewer resources for reducing plastic than other places.  For instance, I was trying to buy texturized vegetable protein for a recipe the other day and I cannot get it unless its shipped (in plastic) to me, or I commute more than an hour to a larger grocery/co-op with a bulk section.  Also, there are many products packaged in plastic that someone could make themself, but where there may be a scale issue (talking about tofu especially).    
  
I'd love to connect with others who may be able to 'carpool' grocery runs to those larger stores, or who may be interested in making and sharing items that can be homemade and plastic free but that take effort to where it would be helpful to 'pool' them.  Does anyone know of any lists of groups regionally?  Nextdoor seems like it's the closest for finding what I want, but people seem leary about these things on there, so I'm thinking I may have better luck asking others who are trying to reduce plastic if they know of any leads.  Thanks!
