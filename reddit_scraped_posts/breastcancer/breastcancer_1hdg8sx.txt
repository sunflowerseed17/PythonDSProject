So, like the title states, I just found out that I have breast cancer. I'm 49yof, healthy, and scared out of my mind. I have multiple small IDC HER2+ tumors and at least one affected lymph node. I've read several posts on here which have helped so far, seeing that it seems I am in the worst part of the fight right now, which is the unknown... the waiting. Don't go to oncologist until next week, so really know nothing right now other than what the pathology report and radiologist have told me. I'm thankful I have found this community; I feel that I am going to need all the courage and support I can get...
