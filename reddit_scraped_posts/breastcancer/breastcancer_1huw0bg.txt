Hello I am 31 diagnosed in october with dcis and idc stage 2 grade 2 triple positive. 

I am 2/6 cycles. I'm having a hard time seeing the end of it all, and getting myself down by reading about reoccurrence. I feel that it's going to come back eventually.

If anyone has any advice or positive stories to help ðŸ™‚
