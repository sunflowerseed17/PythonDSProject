She has 2 small children who are cared for by our mom while my sister works. My mom will likely be caring for me while I deal with this, which means my sister will be short on childcare. She herself may also wind up caring for me some days, as our mom has health issues of her own that mean she's not always available.

My question is: does anyone have any experience/information about applying for intermittent  FMLA in a caretaker capacity? Any information on what my sibling would need to present to her boss? What I may need to provide to her so she can provide it to her employer?

Thanks in advance ðŸ¤—
