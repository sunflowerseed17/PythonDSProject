Someone was selling off this cutie for 1/3 off retail price so my collection of Cancer Support Cuddlies increases! Merry Christmas to me I guess lol. 
The jammies are cute and he is very nice to squish - the mismatch of the pattern in front is a detail I think is oddly adorable. 
His small size also makes him really easy to carry around everywhere even more than regular ‘Medium’ Bashful plushies.
