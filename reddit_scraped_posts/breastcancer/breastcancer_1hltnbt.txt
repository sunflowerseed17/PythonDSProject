I've heard about chemo causing a metalic taste, but I have a sour/bitter taste in my mouth that develops after eating.  I seem to still be able to taste food OK, and the aftertaste does seem to dissipate quite a bit after eating.  (I'm not too sure about this one to be honest, since I'm always grazing.)  Is this something others have experienced too and has anyone found a way to offset it that doesn't involve gargles or mouthwashes?  I feel like even eating ginger would give me a sour/bitter aftertaste.  : /

  
Edit:  I cut coffee back out. I gave it up decades ago because I'm very caffeine sensitive. I had gotten some decaf because I heard it may help with liver health. Decaf had too much caffeine in it, so I got some dandelion root for liver health instead. When I cut coffee back out the sour aftertaste went away. That is some strong stuff!
