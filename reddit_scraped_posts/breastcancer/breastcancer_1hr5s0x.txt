There's the way you do it.

And it makes all the sense in the world that we want to outsource our wisdom because we live in a culture that wants things to be perfect, risk-free, successful the first time, and most of all, RIGHT. GOOD. I am not exaggerating when I say that on a bodily level, where there is no logic or nuance, getting it WRONG "feels" like certain death.

You have a big picture goal.

You know why it matters to you and you've checked it for shame.

It's aligned with what you value.

The next step is to try something and see if it moves you in the direction you want to go.

This includes:

Injection location.

Injection time.

When to move up a dose.

Track calories or not.

Weigh once a day. Weigh once a week. Weigh after pooping. Never weigh.

Having a glass of wine (or not).

Seeing how you feel when eat or don't eat \_\_\_\_\_\_.

Whether to try Mag07, Miralax, probiotics, fiber supplements, electrolytes, ginger chews, Pepcid, protein shakes, protein bars...

What to say when someone notices your weight loss/asks you how you did it...

Whether to share far and wide or keep it close to the vest.

How you talk about the food you eat or don't eat, and the exercise you do or don't do...

How you talk to yourself, about yourself <------- this one!

Noticing how it feels when you say things like "I eat clean" or "I have this bad habit" or "I'm working hard," etc. <----- none of these things are good or bad...they're not even facts...only you know what effect they have on you. Taking a moment to examine that effect is priceless.

**There is no perfect, risk-free, right way to do this.**

Obviously, asking questions, gathering information, and commiserating is helpful and goes a long way towards feeling safe, which is important. But ultimately, you're the one who is taking that next step. And then you get to evaluate if you like the results of that one step :-)

Here's to our collective 2025.
