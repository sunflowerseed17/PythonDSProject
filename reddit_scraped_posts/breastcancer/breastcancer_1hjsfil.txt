Hi, I'm in chemo and living a mile above sea level.  While my labs have generally been great, I am slightly anemic, and my last labs showed some indications of liver stress.  This could be due to having one beer a few days before my labs, but with treatment, I have been eating some frozen meals and vegan mock products that I don't ordinarily eat as I avoid coconut and palm products.  To curtail this, I plan to make vegan burgers tomorrow to have on-hand for when I'm lower energy and want something different than the soup/curry/dahl I make weekly and the usual kale or radicchio salad.  I have usually made non-meaty vegan burgers before, but plan to make this recipe tomorrow because it's high protein and chemo may increase protein needs- [Meaty High Protein Vegan TVP Burgers â€“ My Plantiful Cooking](https://www.myplantifulcooking.com/high-protein-tvp-burgers/#%f0%9f%8d%94what-you-will-need).  I plan to make this recipe as is to learn it first, but I'm interested in modifying it later to add flax for cholesterol health and blackstrap molasses to aid iron absorption.  Anyone have any suggestions on proportions to use for such modifications?
