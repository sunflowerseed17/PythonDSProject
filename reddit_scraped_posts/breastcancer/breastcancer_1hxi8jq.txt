I’m preparing for everything but no dates yet. I know I’m getting a DMX at least. 

So. Easy to put on clothes. I’m plus size, and find button or snap front stuff has been really tough. 

I am a stay at home parent with chronic pain, so I often wear buttonless leisure fabric dresses or just my soft bathrobes. I can sleep in those robes, so I was thinking of getting a few for home. 

But that doesn’t help me for leaving the house. Even button/snap fronts seem like they’d be really difficult to put on post surgery without help. I’ll have  help, can I get away with something like my soft stretchy tanktops if I have some assistance putting them on? 

Any other clothing related recommendations welcome.
