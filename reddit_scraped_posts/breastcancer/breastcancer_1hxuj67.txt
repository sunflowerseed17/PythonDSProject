Well...

I had 2 biopsies. The first one basically confirmed breast cancer, they're just trying to figure out what stage.

I uploaded all my labs to chat-GPT and it thinks stage 3A. It has predicted every single thing outlined on my labs to an eerily accurate extent.

The good news: I discovered that there's a maximum amount of fear I could feel. The other good news is that there's also a maximum amount of devastation I feel. It doesn't get worse than that. Devastation and fear seem to be capped but Idk anymore you guys :(

HOW THE HELL DO I HAVE BREAST CANCER I JUST TURNED 35.

:(

I am scared you guys. It mostly feels like its a dream. I've lived with the news for a week. I've already panicked, freaked out, cried, went 2 nights without sleep, overate, underate, and Idk where I'm at now. I guess I'm still numb and in shock. Waiting for myself to wake up from a seemingly fresh nightmare of a new year.

I had to get this off my chest, I guess. I SERIOUSLY hope the rest of you are having a better new year than I am :(
