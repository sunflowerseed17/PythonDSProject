EDIT:  I didn't put this in the post so I will clarify here.  It's not about checking No on the invitation.  It's not about telling the son no, he I'm sure couldn't care less if I attend or don't.  It's about speaking to my friend about not wanting to go.  She will hound me until the day I die about why I don't want to go if I give a generic vague "can't attend", she will absolutely ask "what plans".  She's a wonderful person but sometimes has trouble understanding that not everyone has her point of view, until you repeatedly slam that fact in her face.  I guess I was looking for an 'easy' way out, but I understand now that I'll have to have a sit down conversation with her letting her know I'm just not comfortable at weddings.  Maybe there's a parents-of-the-bride-and-groom sub that this question would be better suited for!  Thanks everyone for responding (except that person who suggested I lie).



I'm invited to a friend's son's wedding.  I have zero interaction with the son, and would not in the least be upset had I not been invited.  I see the friend 3/4 times a year, and we text occasionally.  I dislike weddings immensely, and am not socially comfortable around people I don't know.  I really don't want to go, but she seems excited that I will be going.  How to best decline the invite without lying or being rude?  It's on a Thursday night (I presume it's night), about an hour away - neither which is a problem for me.  I know honesty is best, but how to present this is what I'm looking for advice on.  Maybe I'll just go to the wedding itself and skip the party?  How weird is that?
