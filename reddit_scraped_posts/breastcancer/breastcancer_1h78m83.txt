So. Now I have breast cancer. I found out on a work trip in the middle of a keynote. I have my dr appt soon. Just sharing I guess, because my husband is not acknowledging that I have it, and I feel a little alone. 

EDIT: I want to thank everyone - I can’t believe how quickly I’ve been surrounded by support. I’m crying, yet I feel safe. Thank you. Truly, just thank you for reaching out with such selfless support.

EDIT2: I will need surgery - I have an appt with the surgeon on Monday. Can anyone share their experiences with a double mastectomy? How painful? Recovery time? Etc…?
