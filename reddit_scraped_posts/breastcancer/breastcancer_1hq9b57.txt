I had my b cancer surgery which equated to a b reduction because it was an option. I wanted a full mastectomy (I was a GG) the dr said it was an option because of the type of cancer and reconstruction would be easier. I agreed however I am still in pain almost 2yrs later.  

Has anyone else dealt with this. I talked to every Dr not one heard me when I told them about the pain. I did 6mo of PT and still pain. I understand nerves cut but it's still hard and painful. Just curious not asking for diagnosis or treatment just wondering if this is my life. Thank you.
