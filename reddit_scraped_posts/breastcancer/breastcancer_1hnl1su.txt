We will be in DW on the 6th and are planning to do Magic Kingdom that day. We are staying on resort so can get there early. Is it worth it at all to do the after dark/hour event ticket? They are $175 on top of what we are already paying to be there for the 5-10. The plan right now is one park a day but we are also considering adding park hopper maybe to the day we are doing animal kingdom. Thoughts and insight appreciated.
