I'm 80F ++-,  my surgery (BMX) is looming on New Years Eve, and I'm a little shaky, as is.  Then yesterday I got a letter from Medicare saying they "found an issue with my Medicare number" and enclosing a new Medicare card.  I logged on to the Medicare website and, via chat, confirmed that this was legitimate and not a scam.  Thankfully my old number is good until January 13, so at least I don't have to go through the hassle of notifying all my providers until after surgery.

Just wondering if anyone else has run into this?
