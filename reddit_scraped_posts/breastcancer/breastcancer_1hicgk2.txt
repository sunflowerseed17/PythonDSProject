I have had to have two surgeries in the last six and a half weeks. The last surgery was 2 1/2 weeks ago. I had a hematoma after the first lumpectomy. The second surgery involves removing the margins for a surprise, tumor, flushing, the haematoma and moving around a bunch of tissue for cosmetic reasons. Iâ€™m guessing I should just be patient because itâ€™s only 2 1/2 weeks. The steri strips are still in place. I donâ€™t want to remove them until they fall off by themselves. Mostly because I had a really bad experience the first time. Anyways, does anybody have tips on how to stay comfortable after six weeks of a painful, itchy, sore and semi swollen breast?ðŸ’•
