I have a model LAT9604AAE Maytag top loader washing machine. It will not fill with hot or warm water on the wash part of the cycle but the hot water works for the rinse cycle. Any idea what's wrong and how to fix it? I had the whole timer dial replaced a couple years ago and it's worked perfectly until now.

I bought it used and was told it was manufactured before whirlpool bought them out.

TIA!
