I had 2 lumpectomies. The second one was for better margins. The two surgeries were within 2 weeks from each other. They didn’t put any drains after the surgery. 
It’s been 4 weeks since my last surgery and I had a review appointment with the plastic surgeon today. He removed about 107ml of fluid from inside my breast. Is this common with lumpectomies?
