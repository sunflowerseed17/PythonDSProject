Maggie passed away today. She was so young, and she suffered so much. I followed her and read everything about her. There is literally no single day I get on my news feed and it does not say someone died from cancer. However, this one hit me harder. Maybe because she was only 23 when she was diagnosed? Maybe for all the harsh treatmemts she had to face all these years? Maybe because she was so resilient? I do not know. I just know it was so heart breaking reading that she died today ...
