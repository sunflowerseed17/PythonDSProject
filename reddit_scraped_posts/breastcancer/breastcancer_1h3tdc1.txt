Hi there! First of all, I want to say thank you for all in this community. Read the history is making me feel better at all! 

So, I am 40 years old. 2 kids. I was diagnosed with IDC 3.2cm left breast last Tuesday. I am in Canada - Toronto and I am waiting the hospital call me to book a surgery appointment. I don’t have any more results at this time. 

This waiting is making me crazy. I don’t stop to cry. I am always trembling of fear. Feeling tired, and feeling pain. And every pain I think that is “something worse”. 

Today, I feel like a little bit back pain. Pain like burning. So, I cried a lot because of this. I had this same back pain for my entire life, but now I am sooooo scared. I don’t know if my mind is doing this or it is a “real pain”. Does someone experienced the same thing?

Thanks!!!
