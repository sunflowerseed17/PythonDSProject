We were leaving Target and she was sitting in her car next to the sidewalk and sarcasticly shouted out "Stay germ free!" And I glanced at her because I couldn't compute what she was saying, then she followed it up with something about covid. I then realized what she was talking about. My mask. Oh good grief. I yelled back "I have cancer you fucking idiot!" And kept walking. I don't raise my voice and I'm the most conflict avoiding person so this was a little out of character for me. Anyway, just wanted to share with people that could understand. I hope she has the day she deserves. ðŸ™‚
