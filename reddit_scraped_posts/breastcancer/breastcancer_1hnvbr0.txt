I had two different biopsies today and I saw on my chart the post mammogram for marker placement results- essentially just stating that the markers are in. However they did describe the micro calcifications that were initially "indeterminate" as "faint" I know I'm reaching here, but is that a good sign? Nothing else really I gathered from that other than I now have a small hemotoma, likely from the procedure.
