Today is day 5 after my shot, meaning I'm back in the hungry zone. I overate at Thanksgiving and never again! But I've kinda taken yesterday and today "off" to enjoy. Having a few glasses of wine, eating snack cheese and other goodies etc. Not splurging but I just need a day to enjoy food and not count calories. It's been a tough few months of stress and other health issues. I've been on 4mg for 6 weeks and it's worked well. At first I thought it was time to move up to 5mg but I think I just need a day to stress eat/drink and then go back on plan. Anyone else feel like this?
