Can anyone give me some idea of what’s to come? I am post menopause. I had my lumpectomy and SNB on 19th Dec. Pathology results will be given to me on 3rd January. Surgeon was convinced nodes would be negative, then the nuclear bone scan results weren’t so good. 

I’m on Letrozole …. That’s it for the moment. I’d just like an idea of what might be next for me …..seems chemo isn’t a treatment for this really. I think it’s unusual to get this de novo with lobular.
