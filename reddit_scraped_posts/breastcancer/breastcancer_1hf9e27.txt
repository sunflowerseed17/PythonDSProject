Was just reading the doctors notes for my DMX I had on Friday. It states that “ two lymph nodes with high activity were identified. They were also blue and were sent for permanent pathology” does this mean my cancer has spread to lymph nodes? Anyone have high activity lymph nodes that weren’t cancer?
