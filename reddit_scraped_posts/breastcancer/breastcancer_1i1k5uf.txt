48yo, ++-, Grade 2/3, Stage 3a, 1-2 lymph nodes 

Yesterday I had my post chemo oncology appointment. I must say, I am SO stoked to finally be done with chemo (AC-T). ü•≥üòÅ However, during my appointment my oncologist mentioned something about the possibility of also doing chemo after surgery (I think he said 6 weeks?). I was trying to keep track of another question in my head so I didn't get to dig deeper on what exactly would determine if additional chemo is needed. Being ++- I didn't expect that information yesterday. 

It's not urgent and I'll see him again in 6 weeks so just seeing if you all maybe know the reason why more chemo would be indicated. The only thing I can think is if there is an additional, different cancer profile after pathology comes back but I don't think that's what he was talking about because we discussed that topic separately.
