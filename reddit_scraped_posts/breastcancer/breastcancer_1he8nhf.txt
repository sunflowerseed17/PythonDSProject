Hello! First time Disney cruiser (we have cruised celebrity over 10 times but after a super disappointing and boring cruise with celebrity last April-we swore never again with our kids) 

anyway we booked a GTY verandah for January on fantasy since it saved about $1500. Happy to take the risk. We have 4 in our stateroom, 2 adults 2 kids. When it says it sleeps 3 to 4, that means we do get the upper birth automatically correct? 

Thanks! ðŸ˜Š
