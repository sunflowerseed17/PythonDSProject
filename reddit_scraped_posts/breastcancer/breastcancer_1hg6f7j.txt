Hi all, I’m rather sick of being dismissed by my oncology team, I’m wondering if it’s normal to have swollen feet and ankles 3 wks after infusion? I’m having my 3rd infusion tomorrow and my ankles have been like this for a week. I called and my oncologist has been MIA since I started chemo she went out on medical leave so I now only see her NP and she constantly dismisses me and placates me to the point where I’m just so frustrated. “Don’t you remember we talked about fluid retention with Taxotere?” No I don’t remember what I talked about yesterday never mind 2 months ago.   “That’s why you need to take the steroids. I know you hate the side effects and you already have horrible insomnia but the steroids will help clear the fluid”  I don’t even know if that’s true but my last infusion was 3 wks ago and I am only on steroids 1 day post anyway.  I felt like my breathing was labored and swollen so I called my PCP and she said go to urgent care. This was on Friday. I got there and they were very concerned until they checked in with my oncology team and then they didn’t even bother to result the urinalysis and cancelled the blood work for cardiac work up. I had a chest xray and it was clear so they echoed what my NP told them and sent me home. I no longer feel short of breath but my ankles are enormous and damn I just do not sleep. Any insight would be greatly appreciate as usual. Thank you! 🙏
