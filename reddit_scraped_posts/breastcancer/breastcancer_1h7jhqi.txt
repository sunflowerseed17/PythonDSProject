I was diagnosed with breast cancer this fall (++-) and am exploring surgery options right now. I was told by one breast surgeon last week that my breasts were likely "too big" for nipple-sparing mastectomy because they are about a 40DDD. She said that I would have to be smaller to qualify, which I could do if I lost about 20 pounds, I think. When I'm a size 8, my breasts are about a C-cup, but I'm about 30 pounds heavier now. Have any of you lost weight to get surgery and/or been told your cup size affects your treatment?
