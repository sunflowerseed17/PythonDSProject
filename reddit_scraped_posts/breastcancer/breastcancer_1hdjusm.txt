I have a little over 400 DIYs and recipes collected. Goldens, ironwood, senmaizuke barrel, lots of seasonals. 

Come to my island and pick through them for free! If you can Iâ€™d love cash or items as tips. Some things I need: 

Retro gas pump
Dharma/mini dharma
Cherry blossom bonsai/DIY
Lots of stone

If you have one of these items and are looking for something in particular, PM and I will pull and hold the DIY just for you. 

Otherwise, climb the vines to the right of the airport and come get some free stuff! 

Please remember to comment your in game name and island. 

Happy holidays everyone!
