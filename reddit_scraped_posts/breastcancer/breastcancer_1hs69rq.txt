Hello everyone, I am stage 3 breast cancer and started Zometa last June (2024). Other than bad nausea it was ok. In October I started having gums issues. November (5 months after 1st infusion) I started noticing an important hair loss.   
I had 2nd infusion on December 2024: I had "flu-like" symptoms minus the fever the first two days. On day 5 I experienced a pretty big blood blister covering the side of my tongue. Awful experience. I've read that is one possible side effect.   
The hair loss is getting worse accompanied by sore scalp and I am wondering if it's not better to cut hair. I don't want to shave but probably having it short could help.

Anyone had the same experiences?
