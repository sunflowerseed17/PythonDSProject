My pineapple conure Zazu got attacked by my Indian ring neck about 10 days ago in an accident (he escaped and went straight to her cage where sheâ€™s territorial). I immediately took him to the vet and was relieved to find out thereâ€™s no internal fractures and his beak should heal on its own along with giving him an antibiotic and pain medicine. I was just wondering if anyone else has dealt with a beak injury like this and how long it took to heal? The vet didnâ€™t prescribe him any topicals to put on the wound but Iâ€™ve been making sure to keep him in a clean smaller cage for now just to make sure he doesnâ€™t further pick at his beak or dirty it on any toys or anything. These pics are of him currently ðŸ™‚ Any advice to help his healing process would be appreciated! His follow up vet appointment to check on how heâ€™s doing will be first week of January.
