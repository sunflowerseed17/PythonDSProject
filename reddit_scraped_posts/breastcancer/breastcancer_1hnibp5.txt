Did anybody else lose all physical flexibility during chemo? I went from above average flexibility to being unable to touch my toes, unable to sit with my knees in butterfly stretch position, unable to sit with legs extended and separated at more than a 90 degree angle. I am working on regaining this flexibility now, but wow, I was not warned about this and it took me by surprise. I did 4 rounds of TC chemo, finished in November. I'm now on lupron and examestane. I'm sure the low estrogen doesn't help either with flexibility.

Anybody have success stories to share about regaining flexibility lost from chemo?
