I started at 238 pounds and am down to 188 after 9 months. It’s been slow but steady. For the past month, I’ve been stuck at 188. I can’t shift any weight. I haven’t changed my eating habits. Actually I never have since starting the injections. 
Maybe it’s time to add some activity and pay better attention to my diet. :( 
I’ve been dealing with the after effects of cancer treatment- chemotherapy, surgery, radiation- and just haven’t had the energy to exercise or eat properly. 
It’s a bit depressing
