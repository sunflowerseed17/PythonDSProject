Hi all, I posted before about my troubles with immunotherapy treatment. I started again after three weeks of prednisone and three weeks of weaning off. My first treatment was February 9, 2024 and my next one will be January 7. I think my schedule last treatment will be around April 1, my oncologist said I had to do nine treatments after surgery, so my next one is like my fifth last one. 

So far, I havenâ€™t had severe side effects with my lungs so much, but I think it may be coming eventually. I still have a lot of gastrointestinal problems and extreme fatigue, muscle aches, nausea, headaches. Iâ€™m not on any kind of medication. 

I know compared to what Iâ€™ve been through, it really doesnâ€™t feel like much longer, I just donâ€™t know if I can make it. My oncologist says that I need to do all the treatments. Does anyone know, Is it like radiation that you have to complete all of them or itâ€™s not effective? Iâ€™ve had it every three weeks since February last year (except for those six weeks ) plus six months of chemo and four weeks rads. On my good days I think of course I need to do everything I possibly can to prevent recurrence, but some days I just cry because I feel so bad and tired and sick.  I canâ€™t believe most people donâ€™t get side effects, I would do over chemotherapy if I didnâ€™t have to do this. Well, maybe not but at least you get drugs to help with that ðŸ˜”
