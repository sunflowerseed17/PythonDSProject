I am going to be having a mastectomy soon. Yesterday, as I stood before the mirror, I couldn't help but reflect on how, just a year ago, I had never imagined I might lose my breast to cancer. My breasts have been an integral part of me since I became a young woman. They have helped shape the woman I am today. They provided comfort and nourishment to my two children with such selfless love. And one of them had already been battered by two lumpectomies, but I can't save her anymore. I feel so heartbroken and so distraught. I had to convince my family and my husband that mastectomy is the right decision for me due to my risk factors. I am putting a brave face for them. But deep down, I am mourning a part of my body that I will lose forever. I will miss her so much. I feel like the best way to grieve this loss is to acknowledge the impact it is having on me.

This loss feels so sudden, and cancer doesnâ€™t give us the time to properly say goodbye to such an important part of ourselves. Still, I want to take a moment to honour what my breast has meant to me. To all the women who have endured this journey before me, I will soon stand among you. And to all the breasts who sacrificed themselves, I thank you for everything you have given us. Farewell, unsung heroes, you will be missed.
