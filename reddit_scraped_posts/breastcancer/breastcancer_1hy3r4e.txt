I was talking to a woman (her son and my son are good friends) who had stage Stage 2 BC. She’s 50. She refused chemo and radiation but does take tamoxifen. I think she was on the borderline for chemo with an oncoscore of 16. She went on and on about vaccines causing cancer, apricot seeds, castor oil and  Rick Simpson suppositories. 

I know it’s everyone’s personal choice to handle their health in their own way but I felt like I was being complicit in this by just nodding and saying “yeah” all the while I don’t agree with alternative treatments in place of traditional medicine and misinformation that goes along with them. I feel like I’m not standing up for myself (and all of you) and allowing these types to ramble on and on unchecked. Has anyone found a good response or ways to deal with this kind of interaction? I don’t want to cause an issue because I like her but I’ve found this often leads to me having to stop talking to these types of people. I’ve had to switch hairdressers and cut off friendships in the past because I get mad at myself for not speaking up and I’m trying to find a better way. Is just saying “Yeah” & “Uh huh” the best way to handle this?
