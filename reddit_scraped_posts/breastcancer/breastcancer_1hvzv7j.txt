I really like my RO, he’s a bit of an odd dude, but he sussed out immediately that I’m a straight talker who has a high level (for a patient) of understanding and knowledge about my cancer and treats me as such. But his nurse is just so awful. I have no idea why she is in the cancer field. She has zero empathy (and I don’t require much!) and she treats me like some kind of OTT whiny baby for clearly and succinctly explaining the new pain I am experiencing in my treatment side since my last appointment.  Which is what they asked me to do. 

And that’s just my complaint from this week!  Last week, I stated that I was experiencing some numbness and fullness in my left arm and asked about being referred to PT. She said over and over that it wasn’t lymphedema and that it was too soon to have lymphedema from rads. Like, yeah bitch, I know that, but I also had eight lymph nodes removed three months ago during my DMX and *that* can cause lymphedema, right!?!  Doc comes in and has clearly been prepped by her to think I’m an idiot, but he’s a good guy and *listens* to me. He then measures my arms and lo and fucking behold, I have the beginnings of lymphedema. Grrrrr.
