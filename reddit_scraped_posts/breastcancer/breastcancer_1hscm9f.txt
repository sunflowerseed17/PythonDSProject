Hi all! I am a 44 yo who is a year post-active treatment. I was Stage 1A, did a lumpectomy and rads and now am on Tamoxifen. I had a clean mammogram in June. But my yearly MRI is tomorrow.

Now I am a major CBD proponent and I am STONNNEEEDDD tonight. It’s a nice little break because I know tomorrow is going to be so freaking scary. You gotta do what you gotta do! 

It’s been a rough year—I feel like I have all kinds of weird complications from surgery and tamoxifen that continue to rule my life. I have so many things I want to be planning, but I have been holding my breath for months now. Which begs the question: how do I ever make any future plans when I am always waiting on some scan? I am doing my best to live in 6 month increments, but it can be frustrating! 

Anyway, please keep your fingers crossed for me! I see my onc RN later in the day tomorrow, so the dream is that results will be available and she can review it with me so I don’t have to ruminate all weekend! We will see!
