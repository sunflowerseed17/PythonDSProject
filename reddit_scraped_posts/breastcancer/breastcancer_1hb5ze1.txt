I have one node that was biopsy and positive. Its obvious on uktra sound. Originally 1.2cm with corticol thickness of 5mm. 
After 2 rounds of chemo lymph node is 8mm and 3mm corticol thickness. 

On original ct it said mildly prominent mostly level 3 ancillary lymph nodes. This was 2.5 weeks after biopsy. The ultra sound tech rode my armpit for 30 minutes and didn't find any more lymph nodes of concern. 

Fast forward, a new Ct scan after 2 chemo still shows mildly prominent mostly level 3 axillary. 1 day after a secondary biopsy.

So my question. If my positive  biopsy lymph node has shrunk within normal limits, mass has shrunk, what are the chances these mildly prominent lymph nodes that don't seem to be changing are cancerous too? 

I know it's a long shot. Doctor gives me 0 information.
