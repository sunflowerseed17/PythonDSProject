I have been diagnosed with DCIS + MI. Got a lumpectomy and due for rads but thinking about getting a mastectomy instead. I wanted to know if there are any others in this channel who also have DCIS+MI and how you're doing whether you received lumpectomy + radiation or mastectomy? I read microinvasion has high rates of local recurrence. Nervous about radiation and wondering if mastectomy patients are doing well. Thanks!
