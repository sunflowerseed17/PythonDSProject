This sweet baby let me pet him before my cancer treatment on Tuesday. He was the only one in the group of ferals that would approach. He was so soft, and so sweet. Today when I went back for more treatment, he approached my husband and scrubbed alllll over him. My husband immediately picked him up and put him in the car. We have taken him to the vet and are awaiting all the tests (parasites, FIV, etc) he is not fixed and not chipped. Approximately 1-2 years old. Our 4 cats are all female and I have never had a male cat before. I’m very nervous about the litter box situation…the vet believes he has never had a home so he doesn’t know about litter boxes. Any tips?
