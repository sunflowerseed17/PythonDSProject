I'm 32 months out from a stage I, no node, TNBC diagnosis, and 17 months out from my last treatment (Xeloda).  At my last oncology visit in November, the MO shared with me that 2.5 - 3 years out from triple negative breast cancer diagnosis is the critical time in that most recurrences happen in this time period.  Great!  That's my exact timeframe!  That really messed with my head, because I mistakenly thought the further out I was from diagnosis and treatment, the better my odds were.  I came down from that mind f\*ck and have just been living my life.  Except for the last 2-3 weeks, I've had mostly constant pain in my hip.  Dull pain when sitting (which TBH I've been doing more of since I've been on xmas break since 12.20) and when sleeping on my side.  And my wrist.  And my pinkie finger.  And in November I remember complaining to the MO that my neck had been bothering me for just shy of 2 weeks.  Very likely could be osteoarthritis, or arthritis or pain related to my knees.  Had I not had cancer, and had my oncologist not told me to be extra vigilant, I'd just brush the pain off as a normal part of aging.  So I'm going to call his office tomorrow and request to be checked out.

I've been googling a bit, is a bone scan the first thing that will be ordered?  I've read that you get the nuclear tracer injected in the morning, then come back later for the actual scan.  About how long does it take to get an appointment?  I don't want to miss too much work so hope I have flexibility in scheduling.  If anyone wants to share their stories, I'd like the company.  Thx. ðŸ©»
