Hi I lost my brother to Brain cancer 3 years ago, and it nearly broke my family. Now I have been diagnosed with breast cancer. 

I have not told anyone, because I am waiting to see the surgeon to find out how serious, what stage, what kind of breast cancer, etc….

The pathologist didn’t have much to say, other than it’s cancer. 

I don’t want to tell anyone until I know what I’m looking at. So I thought I would post here. 

When did you all tell immediate family. I am telling my therapist today.
