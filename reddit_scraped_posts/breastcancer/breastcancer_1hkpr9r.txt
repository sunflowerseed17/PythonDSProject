Has anyone else noticed that their diarrhea seems to occur further and further out from their infusions as treatment goes along? I'm on day 8 from my 4th and I'm starting to get the dreaded bubble guts (so I know the diarrhea is probably brewing). For the most part, I seemed to be more on the constipation side, but I'm getting hit with a round or 2 of diarrhea around the later days.
