The nurse at my surgeon’s office says they are going to send me for physical therapy after my next appointment — anyone else been through this and have any experience?  

I had DIEP flap reconstruction and a double mastectomy on 12/2, and the recovery has been tough but I feel like I’m pretty mobile.  I have a little trouble with my left arm because my left breast is still unfortunately really swollen and the swelling extends a bit into the armpit but that’s it.
