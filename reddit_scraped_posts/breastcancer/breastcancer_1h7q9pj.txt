So I’m really struggling with losing my hair. I spoke with my mom about this. I found a hat she crocheted for me awhile ago and it’s the first thing that I don’t hate. I sent her a pic of it on me and asked if she would make more like this (she has been asking what she can do). Her immediate response, “you don’t look like you”. Well no f’ing shit. Apparently if I don’t look perfect, I’m not ok enough. I had already told her how much I was struggling with losing my hair.
