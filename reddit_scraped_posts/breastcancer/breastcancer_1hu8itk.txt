For those who are recovering from double mastectomy, I just wanted to report that having reached my two month mark out from surgery with spacers, the "iron bra" sensation has subsided. On top of straight up pain, I was also having extreme skin sensitivity. A soft cotton shirt brushing my chest was excruciating. This feeling has begun to dissipate. I have stopped taking as needed gabapentin for nerve pain after 6 weeks. I was losing hope of ever feeling comfortable again, but here we are. I hope this gives hope to those who are still going through this process. Rest and recover. ðŸ©·
