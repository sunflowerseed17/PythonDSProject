Hi everyone,

A few months ago I posted about possibly starting a non-fiction book club, but then got overwhelmed trying to plan all the details ðŸ«£ So with the new year I wanted to just go ahead and kick it off without overthinking it. 

I thought we could start with **Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport**. I figure a lot of us may be interested in better managing our screen time and other digital habits, so this could be an interesting one to explore together. Itâ€™s a fairly short book, not too dense, and should be easily available for folks to buy or borrow in print, ebook or audio format. 

For the discussion group, weekday evenings seem to be what most people wanted, so Iâ€™d like to propose **Thursday January 30, 7pm**. That should give everyone enough time to read it before we discuss. 

Iâ€™m working on booking a location but it will either be in center city, or in Northern Liberties simply because thatâ€™s where I am ðŸ™ƒ Iâ€™ll confirm the location details within the next couple of weeks. We can of course rotate locations depending on what suits the group. 

If youâ€™d like to join this first session, please fill out this quick Google form just to help plan numbers. Iâ€™m going to cut it off after 15 people just for space constraints and to make sure everyone will have a chance to speak at the discussion, so please only sign up if youâ€™re serious about coming along (if you end up not being able to come for whatever reason, no biggie, of course). 

**EDIT: JANUARY GROUP NOW FULL, SIGNUP CLOSED**

Iâ€™ll also start a thread here so folks can still discuss the book if theyâ€™re not able to join us on 30th. 

Also donâ€™t worry if you donâ€™t manage to join this one - Iâ€™ll do fresh signups for each one so everyone will have opportunities to join in as Iâ€™m sure people will rotate in and out due to availability and interest in whatever the book is. We can also run more than one meetup a month maybe in a different location or virtually.

In a couple weeks Iâ€™ll also share info about how weâ€™ll choose books and plan future meetups - anyone whoâ€™d like to help coordinate is welcome to!

Iâ€™ve never even been in a book club before and am nervous about putting myself out there like this (What if nobody turns up? What if too many people turn up?) so Iâ€™m trying to plan it right without stressing too much. I hope we can start something fun and make some new friends! 

Hereâ€™s to a well-read 2025 ðŸ¤“
