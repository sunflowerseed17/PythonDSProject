I didn’t realize I was having another CT for the mapping. They said I would get in the “machine”. I guess I was expecting to get in the actual radiation machine. Anyways…

I also had a CT for staging. My question is…do they look for things on this CT scan like they did the staging one? Will they compare it to my previous one? Will they let me know one way or the other? I think I just unlocked new scanxiety I wasn’t prepared for.
