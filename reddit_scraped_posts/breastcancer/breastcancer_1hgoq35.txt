Hello, I had an appointment with my radiologist and he said I will need 16 sessions of radiation and maybe 4 extra boosters sessions if needed. But they will determine that in the end of the treatment . I honestly didn’t think to ask the doctor how he will make that determination. I will see him again next week. Does anyone know what exactly are the “boosters “ radiation ? 
He also said I will need to have a CAT scan prior to starting the radiation. He said the CAT scan will determine the exact area the machine will be targeting .  Is this CAT scan a whole body scan ? Or just on the breast?
Sorry for so many questions. I should have asked as he was explaining the treatment plan but obviously the questions came to me later .
