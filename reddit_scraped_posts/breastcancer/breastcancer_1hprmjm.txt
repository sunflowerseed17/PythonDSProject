Title: Dark areola from radiation.  Hoping it fades.  Anyone with this experience know if it will lighten over time?

i had 15 rounds of radiation that just ended last Friday.  My breast is sore and swollen,  a small rash on my upper chest area, and the incision area hurts more.  But the part I dislike most is my nipple, areola area looks so dark and even the skin is more raised and hard.  

I’m pretty fair skinned but have some Italian in me so I have an olive hue and can tan.  I’ve been trying to read people’s experience with radiation and if the skin turns lighter eventually, but I’m still unsure if my boob will always look like this now,  with the super dark areola,  compared to my usually very pale pink one.
