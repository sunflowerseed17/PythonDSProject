When I hit menopause I realized my family missed out because I stopped PMS neurotic cleaning! I was given a break from chemo this week because of holiday scheduling on their part. Having a break gave my system a chance to recharge and today I went bonkers cleaning and purging. I cleaned my desk. I purged my “burn pile” boxes, I organized my living room shelves, and more. I hate cleaning - but this felt so good. I was productive. I tackled my hot spots (thank you Flylady). I know I only have tomorrow until I go back to chemo reality on Tuesday - but I feel good.
