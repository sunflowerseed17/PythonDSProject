I had the most amazing time since about mid-September (it’s now mid-December so 3 months), with restored libido, near normal sensitivity, orgasm intensity etc. And since about a week it’s back to the baseline, which is obviously discouraging. However, I made some observations. 

The last time I had a window like this was last year while experimenting with ginkgo biloba. Both times the window was during a very stressful fight or flight period (job harassment last year, breast cancer this time). My theory is now that spiking cortisol levels (and ginkgo) increase dopamine and norepinephrine which overrides whatever SSRI got broken. I don’t want to take medication to try to emulate the stress effect (Bupropion would be one possibility). I’m considering experimenting with HIIT, cold showers etc. 

Does anyone have similar ideas?
