Did you have fluid buildup after your drains were taken out?  I had a DMX with implant reconstruction on 12/5. I’ve had fluid removed two weeks in a row and am stressed about it happening again.  
Is it normal going from having drains to zero fluid?? I was getting less than 8 CCs per day when they were removed two weeks post-op. I just want to feel normal.  Or know if I am, in fact, not normal.  😁
