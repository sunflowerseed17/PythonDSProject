Well. 2 weeks ago yesterday I learned I had breast cancer. I am triple negative. Tomorrow morning at 6:30am I’m getting a mastectomy. And of course learn if the cancer is in my lymph nodes. 

I’ll wake up tomorrow after surgery with no breasts. As it should be right now. 

I am good with the surgery though I’m nervous. I am way more nervous about after surgery. Like did they find cancer in both breasts or in my lymph nodes. And the stage. 

Good luck and love to everyone on this sub. I feel your experiences as if they were my own. You all rock the world and I wish you all beauty and strength that you need when you need it.

❤️

EDIT: surgery done! Yesterday had some recovery bumps (one of my drains had a cut in it and wasn’t draining but then ‘burst’ with blood everywhere- the pressure drop made me nauseous and dizzy with lots of pain)

I’m doing good now! And my lymph nodes are clear! Next step is path results and potential chemo! 

Thanks for all your well wishes everyone!!!
