Hi all!

I was told I achieved PCR after surgery in August 2024. Lately Iâ€™ve been freaking out that there is something growing back underneath my nipple, even though I just finished rads in November and Iâ€™m still doing immunotherapy.

For those of you that had a lump, how long did you notice it growing for before you got it checked out? I feel like most people get it checked right away. I know itâ€™s super bad, but I had mine for a while before I went in to get it checked. Like, at least a year. It was only until it started to hurt and affect my day to day that I went and got it checked. I donâ€™t have a doctor, and I was just one of those that thought thereâ€™s no way it could be cancer when Iâ€™m young. Iâ€™ve also always had fairly lumpy boobs and had cysts when I was younger. I feel like Iâ€™m always gonna be scared thinking about it coming back for the rest of my life now. ðŸ˜ž

I was stage 2b when I was diagnosed. Iâ€™m always wondering if I went in earlier what stage it would be. How long did you all wait before diagnosis?
