My case is not common. I had removed antumor (lumpectomy) that appeared "benign" and ended up being TNBC. It eas 1.6cm (16mm) and pathology shows clear margins. 

My iK67 is 5% what is very low for this type of cancer. Does anyone had this and what treatment did you take. I have a MRI to check if there is any more tumors, and I'll later have a lymph node biopsy.

I really hope it's not in my lymph nodes. All I have read is a low iK67 in TN might not have response to chemo, so surgery and radiation are better option. Any one with a similar case? 

All Thai is driving me crazy! I'm mentally exhausted. Extremely scare of chemo, surgery and reoccurrence.
