This may be really stupid of me to ask after I have already made the arrangements and about to leave in a couple of days but i have heard from so many people that traveled during and after treatment that I just wanted to do it. I finished radiation 2 weeks ago (chemo and surgery done, waiting for oncologist to get back to me about more immunotherapy and Xeloda) and booked a roundtrip flight to New Mexico from California. The flying is not too long-It is not a direct flight so I fly  +2 hours, layover then another +1 hours to destination.
I am packing all my creams to apply on my radiation burns and taking just in case meds. Anything I should do or not do?
