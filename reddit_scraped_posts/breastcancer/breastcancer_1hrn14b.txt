Oh wise women, I seek your insight. I am five months post double mastectomy (DCIS Stage Zero, lymph nodes clear) and it hasn’t been easy. My incisions are a constant source of discomfort clearly from the nerves trying to heal and repair. I can’t walk around without a little pressure bandage… it’s as if gravity is pulling the skin and scars down and that creates irritation. By the end of the day, I’m just walking around while rubbing my chest to soothe them.

I’ve also been struggling with recurring nausea from day one… and that is not improving much. I have been stuck at home for months as I never know when the nausea is going to strike. I’ve had to cancel lots of appointments because I just feel so bad some days and then fine the next. I was never prone to nausea before the surgery… but I also had my gall bladder removed three months before they found the cancer… so am struggling with keeping to a very low fat diet. Two major surgeries in four months was brutal.

Lastly, I just don’t feel like myself. I’m a lot more anxious and still stunned at times by the diagnosis. My body feels weak. I haven’t been able to do the workouts or long walks that I used to do before surgery. 

Any suggestions on coping with this? Suggested reading? - Jill
