Hey ladies and gents, I posted about a month ago about a spiculated mass, and I couldn't get in for imaging blah blah blah. Well, it's grade 2 invasive ductal carcinoma.   HER2 Pos but my Ki 67 score was 30-40%.  It's aggressive and treatable.  I just got the news this morning and to be honest, I feel relieved.  Sounds crazy but I am.  Now I know what I'm dealing with.  I knew it was cancer all along and I've been planning and preparing in my head for every variable that life will throw at me. I'd say that is my coping mechanism.  Well, now to move on to the next step closer to cutting these tits off because I will not go through this shit again.  


Edited to add that I have a surgical oncology appointment booked on the 28th and before then an MRI will be scheduled to check on the lymph nodes and whatnot.  I've been in a good mood all day now even when telling my clients at work what the results were.  My primary called me herself today to discuss and then left it to the nurse navigator.  I'm still so scared that it's mestasized, and i won't get into that now.  All of you have posted 100000 times that it takes forever to be diagnosed, and before you know it, you're being treated.  I echo that sentiment.  Cheers, dolls and dudes.  Thank you for your time, and I hope my little story helps someone navigate this cluster fuck.
