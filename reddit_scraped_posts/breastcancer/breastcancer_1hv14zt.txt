I have been really thinking about what program/trainer to follow this month. I was diagnosed with breast cancer right before Christmas and my motivation (obviously) has tanked. I want to stay active and eat healthy, both of these are a struggle right now. Looking at the Go program, I think I’m going to stick to this. It is short and has both strength and cardio. Even if I have to use lighter weights, I will be getting some regular movement. Now is not my season for gains, only to maintain strength and wellness for the challenges ahead. Doing day 1 this evening! Let me know what you thought, if you’ve already completed it. ❤️💪🏻
