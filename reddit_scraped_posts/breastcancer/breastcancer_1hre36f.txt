I went for a regular mammogram and of November. They wanted to do a deeper one plus an ultrasound. They recommended a biopsy based on the findings. Just got word this week that it's malignant. The report say it's grade 3 invasive mammary carcinoma. The tumor is 6 mm and has necrosis and calcifications. They also biopsed another spot on the same breast and it was benign.  I am meeting with a surgeon tomorrow. I'm 42 and in good health. Not overweight nor do I drink alcohol. I haven't told my family yet and I'm really nervous it's spread and won't be treatable.
