Hi Ladies,

Can anyone guide me who stopped tamoxifen treatment in between and got a baby?

How did you decide to stop and have a kid? Is there a test for it? Does stopping this medicine create any issues?

I am 33 and will be asked to take this medicine. I donâ€™t have any kids yet. I'm thinking about not freezing eggs due to so much stress already.

Thanks
