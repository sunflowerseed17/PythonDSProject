It's my one year CT scan in January after completing chemo earlier this year. I had an appointment with my oncologist in September and she put in the order. In October, I called her office because I didn't have an appointment for the scan and her secretary said that it was too early to send it to my insurance for approval and they will do it in early December and will call me to schedule it. So December comes and nothing. I sent them a message on 12/18 through my portal and again nothing. I called today and one of the nurses? said they will have to send it for approval and will call me back in a couple of days. 

I have an appointment with my oncologist in two weeks to go through the results and I was so tempted to leave it up to them to see if they will ever schedule the scan, just to make my point. My previous appointment with my doctor was me saying that when I was in active treatment everyone was on top of everything and the moment I finished nothing gets done. She was like no, that's not the case and bla bla bla. I'm so disappointed. I don't even know why I'm so sensitive about it since I knew this will happen...

Just wanted to tell someone that will understand. Thanks

And happy new year! ðŸ«¶
