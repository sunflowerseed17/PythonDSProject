Hi everyone - I'm new here but not new to cancer. I went through triple positive cancer 9 years ago (lumpectomy, chemo, radiation, Herceptin, Tamoxifen, the whole 9 yards) and unfortunately I'm back again with a new recurrence of triple positive cancer (will share more about that in another post).  
  
I'm having a hard time (in general) just went through a bit of a denial phase but I need to face this head on it's becoming more real now as surgery options and plans are coming together.

  
That said - I haven't told my kids yet or any family or friends for that matter. I'm not a huge out there share all my info sort of person and I wanted more info before I told my kids (under 13) and of course my mother who will have a million questions.  

Last time around my kids were so little so they were a bit oblivious (I thought my 2 year old at the time would be freaking out when I shaved my head but he just looked at me and said "more cheerios, please!" - typical males not recognizing hairstyle change?)

  
How did you tell your family and friends?  

Thanks
