I'm in the midst of radiation and it's causing a lot of problem with my throat. It's very difficult to chew and swallow things. My husband put together a box of tea, honey, cough drops, pudding, applesauce, yogurt, etc. and dropped it off at my work along with some flowers.

There was a note that made a pun about each item in the box such as "I thought this might app(ea)le to you. I know it's hard, but yogurt this." 

And he's making soup for dinner tonight. He's been so amazing through all of this. I'm so close to the finish line. Last treatment is December 30th.
