So, I should be done with chemo in three months and would like to clean the carpets of the place I'm renting then.  My dog, who usually never goes in the house, has peed on the carpet a few times acting out from moving, and has also had some diarrhea and vomiting inside.  I've cleaned those when they've happened but would like to do a clean that will address both any residual from that as well as addressing any adriamyacin, cytoxan, or taxol that may have gotten into the carpets from sweat on my feet.  This may be overkill, but the landlords will want me to steam clean the carpets anyway before I move.  I figure I may as well do it after chemo because some people are concerned about exposure from the homes of chemo patients and the landlords likely know I have cancer already.  (I said I was moving for medical reasons, without realizing that the town is small enough that the cancer center being the largest specialty clinic at the hospital is a give-away.)  Does anyone know if I can just steam clean with maybe some rubbing alcohol added in to address everything?  I've tried finding more specific information online but haven't come across anything.  I have seen some literature on using rubbing alcohol to neutralize chemo meds on surfaces.  Not sure if this would be safe though with a steam cleaner.
