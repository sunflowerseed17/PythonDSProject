My surgical onco will be performing modified radial mastectomy on Tuesday. Since I have lymph node involvement, they will be using SLNB method to remove level 1 and 2 axillary lymph nodes. My surgeon says that he will use the ARM (axillary reverse mapping) technique to detect which nodes drain the arm and try to preserve them. They may also use some sort of lymphatic reconstruction (he used layman terms so I am not sure what the technical name is, but I assume its LVA (Lymphaticovenous Anastomosis). All of this is being done to reduce my chances of developing lymphedema in the future. Is anyone familiar with these procedures or has anyone had them done during their surgery? I’m very new to all of this, and I want to fully understand what will be done before, during, and after the surgery so that I’m not caught off guard. I tend to freak out and panic when undergoing a procedure (even something as simple as a blood draw) if I don’t know what to expect in advance.

Ps. I hope I am not asking too many questions here. This sub has been a wealth of knowledge for me and I want to make the best use of it before I can go ahead with my surgery. I am kind of panicking with all the new info being thrown at me.
