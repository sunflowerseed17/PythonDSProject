Long post/rant... but someone please tell me I'm not the only one having a New Year's meltdown?!

Had my DMX in late July, a couple follow-up surgeries, and just finished 33 rounds of radiation the week before Christmas. First off, no one told me that feeling low after active treatment is a thing. So here I am, coming to terms with all the feels.

Second, my husband works retail (bless his heart) and immediately rolls into inventory in January. Needless to say, he hasn't been around much and I'm feeling more alone than ever. We didn't have NYE plans due to his work schedule, but he unexpectedly came home a bit early. I had already started feeling sorry for myself hours earlier and was in no condition to want to go out in public.

Rather than getting my shit together, I proceeded to have a cry fest and ruin any hope for a decent night in the very limited time I had to spend with him. I tried to explain why I was upset, which was essentially this:

Everyone acts like flipping the calendar gives you a fresh start. But I'll wake up tomorrow and still be "this." The new me who is unhappy with her body and hasn't been able to do the same things that once defined me. The new me who occasionally skips showering and throws some clothes on 10 minutes before work,, because what does it really matter anymore? The new me who never gets to be the old me anymore.

And the year ahead of me includes picking the lesser of two evils: remaining flat on my radiation side and looking like Frankenstein's monster. Or undergoing some hellacious flap surgery that will be far worse than a DMX (I'm thin with not much to spare).

So, sorry if I'm not really looking forward to 2025. It doesn't change the fact that I have to deal with cancer. Same shit, different year.
