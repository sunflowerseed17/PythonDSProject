36 ++- IDC & DCIS 19mm Grade 2 Stage 1C. Lumpectomy got clear margins and no node involvement. Oncotype 13. Will be having 15-20 Rads coming up. 

Followed up with my Med Onc yesterday 4WPO and of course I have another option. Tam for most likely 10 years. OS+AI for 5 years. This has been the part of treatment I’ve dreaded the most. I honestly thought I would just have the option of tam. My Med Onc said it’s ultimately up to me but she pushed for OS+AI. 

What helped with your decision process?
