I am back at work after being gone for 6 weeks for surgery.  I returned to find that my sub had not handed out a single worksheet, graphic organizer, or printout the whole time I was gone. The bins that I organized for her were still full of all of the handouts for the six weeks I was gone.

The kids told me that she just projected the slides that I made and whenever they asked a question she would say "read the board." She wouldn't allow students to leave class for any reason, including things like band lessons and guidance groups. Admin had to come talk to her multiple times and she still would not let kids leave unless an adult came to get them (this is 7th grade).

Of course, she also didn't grade anything. This woman has multiple master's degrees. I expected her to act like a professional.

The kids are thrilled to have me back after all that, but I'm ridiculously overwhelmed with work and rads are making me so tired. 8 school days left before winter break.
