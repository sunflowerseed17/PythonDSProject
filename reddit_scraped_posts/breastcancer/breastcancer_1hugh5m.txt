Hey, I'm having a hard time and posting a lot, hope that's ok. 
I'm curious if anyone else has had a similar experience, I've been checked out at the hospital and they seemed not worried or unable to do anything 

Keynote 522 with weekly paclitaxel, first chemo on Friday. Neulasta shot on Saturday. 

In general have been feeling really fatigued and foggy from the steroids, and my heart has been racing.

Saturday night was really bad and confusing - I was feeling feverish but no fever, and achey and sick and light headed but my BP was fine and SO SO SO fatigued going to the loo was hard. 

On Sunday I decided to go to the hospital even though I didn't have a temperature, because I was definitely feeling very unwell. 

They did the checking me out things and basically my neutrophils were really really really high . (High like they'd expect if my body was fighting off a major infection in ICU)

From their point of view that was problem solved and they sent me home, but I'm still feeling really yuck and so tired (holding my drink bottle makes my hands shake). 

I am going to bring it up with the nurse and ask if I can see the oncologist before we proceed, because this is really scary and it feels like if it's going to be like this the whole time I'm not sure I can do it. I don't want to stop, I just can't do six months of this, specially if it's also going to get more exhausting).

Wondering if anyone else has had similar unexpected reactions because it's feeling scary how alone I feel.
