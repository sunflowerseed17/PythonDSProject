So I have booked myself a Japanese head spa treatment before I start chemo in a few weeks. I’ll be 6 weeks post lumpectomy and sentinel node removal. I’m obviously gonna reach out to my provider and make sure it’s OK but I just wanted to see what you guys thought and if anybody has done any spa stuff before chemo.
