Just looking to vent or get some guidance. Does anyone else struggle to find compression sleeves or get them covered by insurance? As a youngish breast cancer survivor who now has to live with lymphatic issues i struggle with having to wear an ugly compression sleeve daily. I found lymphdiva but they don’t take fsa and are so expensive out of pocket. I struggle with the fact you can’t even find a basic one really on Amazon. Why is it so hard to get what seems like something so basic
