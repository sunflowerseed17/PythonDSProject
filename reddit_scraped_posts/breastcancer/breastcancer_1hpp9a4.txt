Hello all, first timer here. So I have been dating my girlfriend for a 1 1/2 year. She was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic cancer 10 days ago. I have been educating myself with this diagnoses and making sure I can help her ask the right questions when it comes time for her first consultation about surgeries, radiation/ chemo and treatment plans. Coming up in 8 days. She is in fairly good spirits and trying to stay positive to get through the rest of the holidays. I think after her first consultation it will hit her a little harder. In the meantime she wanted to come up with a better name then stage 4 cancer to try to take away some of the negativity from it When talking about it with each other or around people or kids. Any suggestions would be helpful as well as any info to help new timers get through this situation. I will keep posting with her progress and journey thank you for any love.
