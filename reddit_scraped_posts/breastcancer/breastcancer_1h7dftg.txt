We get our Litter-Robot 4 tomorrow.  Any tips/tricks before we set it up to help prevent issues with it in future ?  We have four (4) cats and are giving it a go before investing in another.  I really like the idea of not having to scoop litter with that many cats.  Two have stinky poos that would peel paint.  (We’ve tried all of the vet-prescribed foods, and then some.  One has a dodgy tummy because of issues when found abandoned and near-starved.  He’s fine now, very active at almost 1.5 yrs old, chasing our 6 and 7 yr old females all over the house … and being chased in return.  🤣)  If it controls odor as well as is hoped, that’s almost worth 25% of the cost alone, saving my poor watery eyes from the vapors.  🤢

We are also hopeful this will help me help DH keep up the cats’ litter and be more sanitary all around.  (I have an immune deficiency and going through breast cancer surgery soon, so we are 🙏🙏🙏 it will make it so much easier on DH now and that I’ll be able to empty after recovery [with gloves, of course].  No worries on the cancer, as we caught it really early.  GET CHECKED, NO MATTER YOUR GENDER OR AGE !!! ❤️ I had ZERO lumps or pain !  It was a fluke that I went before next year.  A nagging “go do it now” thought.  Consider this as me nagging you.  If nothing else, you’re setting a baseline.  If I’d waited with a moderately aggressive tumor, I’d be in a much different situation.)

✌️❤️🥓

ETA:  Still not here.  Likely, the weather has held it up.  I live in an area outside of typical Lake-Effect snow storms, but we had a relatively rough one this week, along with high winds.  I’d not want to drive my car in it, much less a high-profile vehicle in that mess.  Hoping we see it today so we can get it set up before carpet is installed in a week.  Ours are pretty good about using a different litter box.  Maybe our luck will hold out with this one.  They are all super nosy and “competitive potty-goers”, so we have that going for us.  🙄🤣
