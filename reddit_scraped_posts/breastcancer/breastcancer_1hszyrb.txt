Hello, I am new here.  I am a 43 year old breast cancer survivors who is going through chemically induced menopause (due to my course of treatment in trying to starve out estrogen-fed breast cancer).  I went through chemo, surgery, and radiation.  

I am now back at the gym, left orange theory fitness to focus on weight training.  I'm not asking for medical advice.  But I do want to hear from post menopausal women: how are you building and keeping muscle?  I would just like some hope that even though it may seem like an uphill journey, it's still possible.

Did you get ripped after menopause?  :)  Tell me about it!
