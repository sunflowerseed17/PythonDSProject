TL;DR: Got my period back after chemo, but having a second heavy one in just 2 weeks. Unsure if this is withing the realm of normal, should I get medical attention?

I got my period back 2 weeks ago, 5 months after chemo. I'm 36, TNBC, and not on any medication or hormone blockers so it didn't worry me from a cancer POV. I bled a lot more than usual for about 7 days, and had none of the usual cramps  - I'd read this is expected and was generally happy to be "functioning" again.

However, a week after the period ended, it has started again. I got cramps first and was sure it must've been something I ate because it couldn't be another period... It's day 3 and after initial spotting, I'm now bleeding heavily and continue to have moderate cramps that make me want to pop a Tylenol once a day.

Is this something to worry about? Should I go to an OBGYN or my Onco? Most accounts i read here said once the period came back it was irregular and slow for the first few months, but mine seems to be on a warpath and making up for lost time. Help!
