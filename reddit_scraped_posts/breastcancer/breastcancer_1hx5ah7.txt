After the diagnosis I feel like I’m being paranoid. I bought a new glass water kettle and completely ignored the manual about rinsing and dumping the first water. But instead drank everything. I remember thinking the water tasted funky. But my mom reminded me I should’ve rinsed it first. At the time I was like it’s just a kettle, how hard is it to use it. Now I’m in all paranoid mode—how much chemicals and toxins did I ingest, is it cause any more cancer, is it making it coming back..

I don’t even know how it works. But I’m living my life so cautiously. I want to do everything bu the book and scared that I will screw up again. I wish I had read the manual. I hope it didn’t cause too much damage.
