I dont' even know if I need chemo yet (meeting with MO/Surgeon Monday) I was just diagnosed on 12/31. If I need to do chemo I would like to explore options of cold capping. I do have questions for those who have done cold cap or in the process of it all.  If I have thin hair to begin with, does this mean it won't work as well? I have a lot of fine, thin hair. It is naturally curly/coarse. Thanks for any feedback you can provide.
