I was diagnosed with stage one IDC in August. I have had two surgeries to do a lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. Recently, I’ve had some hair falling out in the shower. I told my doctor about this yesterday and she said that it was from having breast cancer. I said to her, I thought that was only when going through treatment. And I swore she said even just having breast cancer can cause this. Has anybody heard this from anybody else? From what I have read about online and from other people in my life, they haven’t heard of it before.
