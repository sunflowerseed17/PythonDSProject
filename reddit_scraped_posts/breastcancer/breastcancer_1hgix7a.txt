My ct scans x2 and ultrasound x many have aligned perfectly related to size of my mass. However mri puts it 5mm bigger. Curious which is more accurate vs false positives. 

As well, ultra sound no9tes only 1 node, but mri notes more mildly prominant. This was 1 week after 1st chemo 

Sorry reaching here. Just looking for mri vs ct vs us accuracy and false positives

Thanks 
Edit. The size of my second mass not biopsies was consistent with ct and ultrasound. 
The biopsied main mass measures larger. Was 3 weeks from biopsy
