Had my first AC infusion a couple of days ago. I felt fine during and for a few hours after. I ate chicken soup and an ice sorbet for dinner. An hour later I felt painful waves of nausea, dizziness and abdominal pain. I threw up about five times before going to the ER. They gave me an IV and 2 doses of Zofran. I couldn’t hold anything down still until the next morning. After it subsided I felt better. I literally thought I was going to die that night the pain was so bad in my abdomen. Day 2 no nausea, no vomiting just extremely tired. Day 3 feeling about the same.

Has anyone else had this happen? 

I’m terrified of my second dose, I’ve considered quitting. I have 3 more doses of AC before 12 of Paclitaxel.
