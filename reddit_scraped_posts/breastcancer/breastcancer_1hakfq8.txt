So I have some vintage playdoh molds, the stiff plastic, 2-part ones that fold in the middle? I want to make permanent figures from them, and the only thing I can think of is to use polymer clay. I made a test piece from some scrap clay and it was a bit tricky getting the forms out of the molds-- had to refrigerate and use a lot of talc. So now I need to invest in materials, and I'm overwhelmed by all the information about which clays to use, how to paint/should you paint, how to seal, etc. Has anyone done a similar project? Any tips? Thanks!
