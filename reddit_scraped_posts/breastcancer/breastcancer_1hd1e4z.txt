I got my MRI today and the results posted to my chart.. My tumor has shrunk but it's definitely not gone which I can feel. Lymph nodes have all shrunk significantly I have 3 nodes showing but much smaller.. I have one more round of AC+ immuno to go. 

I know i might not get PCR and I've heard ppl say that the tumor may not shrink but still be dead inside.... I wanted my lymph to resolve to avoid more chemo but I think that's not going to be an option. Tumor overall is definitely smaller but still large.

Retesting brought back all that anxiety from 6 months ago. I know outcomes are still good for TNBC with the keynote protocol... but days like this sometimes feel so defeating.
