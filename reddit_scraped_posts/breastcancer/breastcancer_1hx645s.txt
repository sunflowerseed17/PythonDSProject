Maybe I think too much, but does anyone else find themselves frustrated by how varied after surgery instructions are? Of course I follow my surgeon's recommendations, but when I see others' stories or even research online, there's so much differing information. 

Some surgeons say compression bra 24/7 and others say it's fine to go without at night/for sleep. The bra I was recommended isn't even particularly compressing (Bali T-shirt bra). 

Mine also said belly binder during the day (for DIEP flap recon), "okay to remove at night", but other surgeons recommendations are the same as the stricter bra instructions; "off only to shower". 

My hip drains aren't out yet (started with 6 total boobs/hips after DIEP; now down to these last two) but I think once they are, the recommendation is to move from binder to Spanx. 

I get there are different schools of thought and medical opinions differ greatly, but as a layperson in the middle of the sea of advice, I find myself exhausted with comparing all the conflicting information and "best practices".

Am I alone?
