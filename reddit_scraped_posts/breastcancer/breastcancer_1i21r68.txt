I finished my last AC chemo two weeks ago.  I was told to take 3 grastofil wbc shot. I usually got neutrophils to 23 with two shots. But they told me to take 3. But now I'm left with persistant tenderness all down my back, ribs, hips and legs. It's better when I stand up. But it's burning pain and it's like If you push on my skin is so so tender as if my whole body is bruised. No fever. No other symptoms. I think I made it worse by trying to stretch it out last week. Heat and cold make it worse tbh. 

Any tips. Did this happen to you. I mean if it's normal and I ride it out that's cool. But it freaks me out. Nurses are not concerned. But I start taxol tomorrow!! I don't know how I can do it! 

Thanks
