Title: Has anyone done a single mastectomy and gone back later to have an implant added to the other side?

I did a bilateral non-nipple sparing total mastectomy a couple months ago. 

I did not test positive for any genetic indicators, but do have a strong history of cancer in my family (breast, skin, brain, cervical ðŸ™ƒ) 

At the time I could not fathom removing the other side, because it was and still is healthy. I decided I'm comfortable with having to do more regular check ups for it. 

My plan was always to use cakes or sticky bras for the natural boob if I was showing more skin and wanted them to look more even (I have quite small boobs). Now that I am getting ready to go back to work and am able to wear more clothes again, I'm wondering if adding an implant to the natural side is something I want to do. I'm not sure if they would insist on another mastectomy or if I can just add an implant so the shape looks more even in clothes(and so I could go bra free). Would adding an implant make it harder to detect another tumor? 

I would love to hear from someone who has done something similar prior to talking about it with my doctor at my next checkup.
