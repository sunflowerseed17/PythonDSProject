In May this year I was diagnosed with breast cancer...like many of us hearing this news it was uncertainty that dominated our minds..the what if's..the fear..the pain..the thought of not being around for ur loved ones...and today I'm with my family watching my 3 boys excited today..making memories...I am soo grateful I'm here and survived....I am grateful for this time..im grateful I survived....for all those going through it and survived and for those still fighting this..I pray u all have a beautiful day...make memories however big or small...merry Christmas my fellow fighters!!!
