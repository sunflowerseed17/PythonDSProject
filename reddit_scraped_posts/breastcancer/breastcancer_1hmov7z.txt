Hi all,

I have 3 mos of Ouisa CF 159226 and 9 mos of Ouisa 159320. 

I have reached out to Ouisa, Zappy, trying to find out which 503-b pharmacy, if any, dispensed my meds. Does anyone else have these CF numbers? My fear is that Denise just put the gray stuff together in her own office and slapped labels on them. 

Thx in advance
