Surgery was 3 weeks ago and I have been healing as expected other than developing cording about 4-5 days ago.  For the past 3 days, I have been massaging to reduce the cording.   

Last night I developed a rash just on the skin over the “empty space” of removed breast tissue that had previously been a recovering bruise after swelling subsided.   This is not where I was massaging and I do not have it anywhere else other than I little bit by the steri-strips near my scar, which is also a new rash.  

I don’t know if the rash is common or whether there is correlation or causation between the massage and rash.  I don’t think it is an allergy to the cream because I don’t have the rash everywhere.   

Seems a trivial thing to call on-call about but I won’t know if it could have more significance.  

Any ideas or suggestions?  Should I call on-call or wait until Monday?
