hi all :)

I know there are already similar posts about exercise or lifting post masectomy but my question is how heavy can I lift after a masectomy? 
whats considered heavy?

i had a single masectomy without recomstruction so im flatâ€¦ im 5 weeks post surgery and needed to move a smaller piece of sofa today with my u affected arm, its sure about 15kilograms..
could
it have affected my wound? since i did it with my unaffected arm? sorry if its a stupid question ðŸ™ˆðŸ˜…ðŸ¥²

and when can I start doing everything i did like before surgery?
