Had my dmx 12/13. It was a 2.4 cm tumor, grade 3, ITC in 2 lymph nodes. + - -, and they called to schedule my appointment with the oncologist January 27. This is only for the consultation. Is this too long of a wait? Should I call to schedule with someone thatâ€™s at a different location but sooner appointment?
