... and of course I can't sleep. My alarm is set for 6, I have to check in to the hospital for 7.30. I'm tired but wide awake. 

I really don't want this surgery (full axillary clearance after 3/3 positive nodes from June's post-SMX pathology report) Up till I turned 45 I'd only ever been in hospital for a tonsillectomy when I was 6 and now I get two horribly Invasive operations 6 months and 1 week apart. 

I don't really trust that this surgery is totally the right path but I'm also terrified about what they'll find or not find. No cancer and my lymphs will be gone for nothing. Still cancer and the chemo didn't work. Dead cancer and the chemo worked but the reccurence risk is higher as well as the possibility of as-yet undetected mets. 

I just can't stop grieving tonight. I feel like I've lost so much and I know I can't ever go back
back, physically, mentally, emotionally, metaphorically.

I've tried to be positive but this shit is getting so *old*. The thought of just pulling the duvet over my head and just not going is really tempting. But I guess I'll go anyway because it's what we do, right?
