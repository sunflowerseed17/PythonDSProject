Hello all,

I am looking for some book reccomendations for my child, he's only 1 but he enjoys reading and I would like to teach him some stories in a way that he's use to. He 3rd generation Canadian, so while me and my husband speak pubjabi, English is our first language. I want him to grow up with our history and religion. We do our nitnem daily, but I do not think I can teach him the same way my parents taught me. I know my faith has been such an important part of my life, I want him to have that for himself. 

Any suggestions are appreciated, I found a couple on Amazon but I am not sure about the quality of the teachings.
