I am due to start TCHP chemo next week and I am just so overwhelmed.  I am so scared of chemo and I can't stop breaking down. I know I have to do it, but I don't want to.  How do folks cope?  Even though my nodes were clear at CT scan in October, I now have 2 suspicious lymphs and am getting a biopsy next week which has also freaked me out.  They waited so long to treat me, now it has spread.  Will chemo kill the cancer in the lymph nodes? Does this change my staging (I was early stage 2).   To top it off, I had a port installed last week and it feels like I have a spoon in my chest.  I hate it.  I am spiraling and don't know how to cope.
