You need to bring a food/drink AND a gift you'd love (even if imaginary).  I'll bring Wawa eggnog - sorry it's not alcoholic, but I can't drink right now, and it's the BEST eggnog. And you know we flippers find the BEST gifts. I'll bring an abstract blue art glass humpback whale. Nope, never seen one, but I'd like one.

Your turn!
