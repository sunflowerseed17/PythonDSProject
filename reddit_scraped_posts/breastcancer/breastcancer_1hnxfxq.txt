Hi all,

My LO just turned 1 year. I've been going through some health stuff so while we were sleeping well in crib, around 8 months of age or  so we end up with like a 50/50 night with him in my bed- we practice the safe 7. 
I am also delayed night weaning but have been able cut is night time milk by 60%

The problem is he really doesn't have the temperament to cry it out, he literally pukes if he cries for more than a min. We try really hard to get him to calm down any time he's upset quickly because of this.

I have been looking at taking care of babies but I don't know if it will work for us.

My goal is 1. To try and night ween over the next month, then 2 work on independent sleep. 
I just don't know what to use?! 

I am okay with taking our time. As it is just what life has dicated. He is still in our master but I have surgery in a few weeks and once that's done we will move him to his own room. 

Any suggestions? Apps? Advice

He is great with naps, and generally wakes up rested he gets 13.5 hours of sleep total. 
Wake windows are 3-4hour and 2 naps a day.
