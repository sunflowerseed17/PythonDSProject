I feel like I’m in limbo. I was diagnosed with Stage 3, Grade 1 IDC (++-)in May 2024. I finished neoadjuvabt chemo 11/2024 and recently had my DMX 12/2024. When I received my pathology report, it indicated that I had a response to chemo but I did not achieve PCR. There was some residual cancer in the removed breast tissue and I had 5 positive lymph nodes. My surgical oncologist let me know that they did get clear margins during surgery and they believe that they got everything out. Next steps for me are radiation and continued ovarian suppression in combination with AI’s and Verzenio or Kisquali. All of that said, no one has told me if I am considered NED or not. When do people typically find this out? It’s really been bothering me.
