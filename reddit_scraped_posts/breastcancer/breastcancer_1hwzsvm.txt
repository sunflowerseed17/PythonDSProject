Hello Everyone, I hope you are all having a great day. I am posting here to seek for group wisdom regarding the signatera test. 

I (35F) am pathological stage 1A , ++-, with one sentinel lymph node involved, and my oncoType is 14. While grateful for catching this early, my mind always goes to the darker place of potential undetected metastatic ever since diagnosed. To make it worse, I was surprised by that treacherous lymph node only via surgery report. Responding to my concerns, my oncologist briefed me about the possibility of request for signatera test for monitoring after active treatment. Additionally, she highlighted that there is no protocols of treatments even if the test comes back positive. Despite this, I am currently leaning towards to request the signatera test. I hope people who have taken the test could kindly help me with my questions below: 

1. When is the best time to initiate the test? Do you usually take it after all your active treatment? 

2. From what I read from their website, it seems like they recommend to do this every three-month until forever. Does you oncologist suggest the same schedule? 

3. Shall I brace myself for battling the insurance company for this? I have yet to encounter any insurance related troubles; However, this looks like will be the first oneâ€¦

4. Is there any other things to look out for? Do you have great or unpleasant experiences with the test? 

Happy New Year and thank in advance!
