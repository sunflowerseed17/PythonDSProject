I had a DMX with implant reconstruction on 12/5. Got my drains out on 12/19. I went back on 12/30 and today and had fluid drained both times.  Last week was 40 and 15. Today was 12 and 15. My plastic surgeon threatened surgery to put the drains back in if it doesnâ€™t go down. 

I live alone so itâ€™s completely unreasonable that I canâ€™t do anything using my arms. I have some help and have let cleaning go but I have to be able to do stuff around home like heating food, showering, changing, etc.  I am so stressed living this way and to be told to stay at home another week has been a killer.  

Is my surgeon all talk just trying to get me to heal? Has anyone actually had drains put back in? At this point, Iâ€™d almost welcome them back if it meant I could leave the house and have a life.  After chemo and a mastectomy, Iâ€™m not afraid of a little drain surgery.  ðŸ˜‚
