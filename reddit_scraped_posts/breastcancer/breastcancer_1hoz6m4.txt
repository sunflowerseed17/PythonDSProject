Had my first HP infusion 12/27 after 6 rounds of TCHP. I had a lot of anxiety about it mostly because I didn’t know what to expect. My BP was the highest it’s ever been. 

I was told the only real side effect is diarrhea, and it’s much easier to tolerate. I feel lied to. After my infusion I came home and passed out for 5 hours. The exhaustion hit me so hard. I feel incredibly tired, just as tired as a round of TCHP. I have joint and muscle pain, an absolutely vile taste in my mouth and food tastes bad, I feel really depressed and emotionally on edge, and the Gi issues started already. 

This shit sucks. I am so not doing this for another 11 rounds. I hate this and I hate my life.
