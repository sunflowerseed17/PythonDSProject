I am the moh planning the bachelorette for my sister in late March. I am lost on where to stay. There are 5 of us total, all in 30s, not huge partiers but will want to go out a couple times for activities and mostly have a relaxing trip. I’m looking at airbnbs in Foley but will it be too cold to enjoy the beach? Downtown seems like mostly apartments/condos and I’d like to have a small outdoor area since we’ll probably enjoy hanging out at the house in the evenings. A hot tub or pool would be a nice plus. Is James island a good area since it’s halfway between foley and downtown? The places seem much cheaper there so wondering if it’s safe?
Open to recs on things to do as well! I’ve already been recommended the rooftop bar at the Dewberry.
