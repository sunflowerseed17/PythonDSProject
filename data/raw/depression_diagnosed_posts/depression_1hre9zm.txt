Hello,


So I've been on SSRIs for over 20 years. My new psychiatrist put me on a medication that is not an SSRI and weaned me off of the SSRI while on the new med. I knew the withdrawal side effects could be severe but what I really want to know is how long the withdrawal effects will last. Considering how long I have been on the SSRIs I'm assuming it's longer than the average 2-4 weeks. Right now I am on week 8 and still have the numbness in my hands, severe vertigo and dizziness that leads to vomiting and occasional panic attacks that hurt my chest. 

As a side note, I am in therapy and have an amazing support system to help me through this transition. I am just curious to know how others who have gone off SSRIs have done and if these withdrawal effects are normal/to be expected. 


Thanks so much y'all!!!
