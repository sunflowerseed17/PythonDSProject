NSFW tag for SI

I am curious about other people’s experiences with people that use talk of suicide as a manipulation tactic to avoid the consequences of their own actions. 
I’m not talking about people that really deal with depression and suicidal ideation and choose to talk about their struggle, I hope that’s obvious. 
For example, one experience I had was while breaking up with a guy I only dated for two weeks. He wanted me to move across the country for him and I was not going to do that, so I decided this relationship was not going to work. He said if I left him that he was going to off himself and it would be my fault, that he couldn’t live without me, etc. 
My questions for the group are:
1. Do you feel compelled to get into how disrespectful that feels as someone that actually deals with these thoughts as a regular part of life? 
2. How would you respond to someone doing this?
3. Is it worth trying to have a conversation with someone that does this? 
I get that people that use manipulation aren’t usually open to receiving criticism, but I am entirely compelled to go toe to toe with these people. It makes me so angry. 

Would appreciate even just hearing about other’s experiences.
