(19m) I am a boy from sweden.  
Tomorrow, I move into my first place, and right now, I'm more scared than ever. I have been in and out of a deep depression since as long as I can remember. Frozen out in school and social anxiety, I have always been partially suicidal thinking if times get too hard, There is always a way out. But the only thing stopping me from actually doing it are the people around me and those who “Love me”. The thought of leaving behind a mother, father, 3 siblings and 3 nephews with them thinking they did something wrong and that I was too weak to stay with them. I can't bare the pain I would bring upon them. But now when I'm finally going to be all alone. I can't trust my own thoughts of what I'm going to do

I met this lovely girl a few months ago, and she really left a hole in me I believe is never going to heal. We had the same energy and everything. After a couple of months of us being together,  I invited her with me to a “Family party” where only the youngest siblings and cousins (and some of their friends) would come to. We had so much fun, i of course had some alcohol and so did she. I don't believe I got super drunk. And we finally get home to me after having a what I thought a good night together, we go to sleep.  
She wakes me up in the middle of the night saying her mom don't feel good, and she needs to leave me to help her. After that moment. I never saw her again.

My mental illness hit rock bottom. I couldn't understand why, and she wouldn't give me a direct explanation,  
I can only imagine to this day what the reason was.

I don't know why I'm writing this text. I guess it's kind of a last, quiet scream for help.
