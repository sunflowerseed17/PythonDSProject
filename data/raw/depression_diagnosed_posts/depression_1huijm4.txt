I have everything I need (materials). I have done everything to battle Depression - counselling, spoke to a doctor, school teachers, friends, people on reddit, tried breathing, religion, journalling, AI for someone to give me advice for. Yet nothing, absolutely nothing has helped. I am out of options and frankly out of time. Im only 16 with all of this pain and trauma. 

I will write my goodbye letters tomorrow.
