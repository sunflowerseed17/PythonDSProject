A few years ago when I was younger I struggled with suicidal thoughts due to a bad home situation. After high school graduation, I took a gap year and started to become depressed. I worked full time around people not my age and I felt very socially isolated, and tried to hang out with friends to feel better. I started college and at first I was okay but then I suffered from extreme burnout and to top it off, had a falling out with a family member. I tried reaching out to some friends I made at college about how I had a bad day or was feeling down and no joke 2 of them didn’t even respond to me when I said I had a bad day and we were standing right next to each other. After feeling so alone already, that pushed me over the edge. I’ve been depressed for over a year and put off going back to therapy. I just didn’t care to deal with it and have to unpack the years of trauma from my childhood. I had this intense sadness that I felt every day all day, nothing makes me happy anymore, I don’t even care to visit my friends. I started therapy but it’s overbearing unpacking my issues bc it adds to my overflowing emotional pain. I just feel like I’m carrying this heavy weight and I desperately want someone to care for me. I have no energy to keep conversations going and often give short replies, I’m irritable with my parents, and I don’t know if I even care/want/or have the energy to get better through therapy. I’m tired and I don’t care anymore. I want to talk to my therapist about this but I’m not sure when it becomes concerning for them.
