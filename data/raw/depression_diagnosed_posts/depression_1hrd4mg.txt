26 years old. When I was younger, I thought that by this age, I would be happy, that I would have started a family and achieved things. Now that I’ve reached it, I realize that things didn’t go as planned. I’m 26, divorced, completely broke, with zero self-confidence, fighting the darkest thoughts in my head. Nothing I’ve undertaken has turned out well.

Relationships? I spent 5 years married, only for everything to fall apart. My world collapsed, everything I fought for went up in smoke. My dogs, my passion, my reason for waking up every morning, had to stay with my ex because I couldn’t afford to take care of them anymore. I miss them so much, I think about them every day—they were everything to me, damn it. Work? I don’t have a job anymore. I’ve become a shell of myself. It’s impossible for me to focus or take initiative.

I started writing all this to describe my life, but I can’t. I disgust myself; I feel pathetic. I thought I was past this depression after 12 years of battling it, but no. I’ve fallen back into it. I’m tired of suffering, tired of these thoughts. I’m tired of these images spinning endlessly in my head.

I’m tired of this body dysmorphia that stops me from seeing myself as I am, that forces me to hurt myself to punish the monster I see. I’m tired of this autism that stops me from living normally, like everyone else on this earth. I’m tired of being nostalgic for my suicidal thoughts, of thinking life was simpler when my existence didn’t matter.

I couldn’t protect my little sister, I couldn’t make my mother proud, I couldn’t make my marriage work, I couldn’t make my businesses succeed, I couldn’t say no.

I’ve failed as a son, a brother, an entrepreneur, a husband, a pet owner, and a friend. I’m pathetic, ugly, undesirable, monstrous, weak. I’m not a man.
