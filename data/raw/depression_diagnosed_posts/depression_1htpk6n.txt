I am autistic and have ADHD, i hate the whole self diagnosis thing but i feel like i am depressed and depression is unlike autism in the sense that you can only be born with autism and there is no way to "get autism". i just feel i dont have the right to say im depressed since it takes away from people with actual depression, do yall have advice or any way to help me? (I dont talk to people in my life about it since i dont wanna make it a whole thing) P.S sorry for how messy the post is i just dont feel like making an organized one rn. i am a male teenager

  
Edit: I have trouble with emotions and empathy and all that i dont always know what im feeling and i also never let people see me cry. everyone thinks im happy and that there is nothing wrong but i genuinely cant manage to love myself, i try to work out and eat healthy but i still see myself as fat even though i know multiple people much fatter than me. I have a great family but i still feel as if there's something wrong, and that something is me, i often think to myself that everyone i know's lives would be better of without me since all i do is bring hardship and trouble to people. i feel like a pervert and often regret not hurting others, i dont want to hurt others but i do at the same time. nothing makes sense i feel like i gaslit myself into all this just to get attention, i dont even know what to think of myself as a person, i hate myself. sometimes i think about killing myself sometimes but im too much of a coward to do it, i think theres something fucked up with me, i dont feel pain like others and i dont feel emotions like others, and no matter what i do i always feel like im not doing it good enough
