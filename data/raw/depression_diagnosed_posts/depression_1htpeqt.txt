Hi my name is Aliyah , i’m 14 . i’m severely depressed everyday i wake up feeling like i have no meaning anymore . i walk around like im happy but in reality i’m hurting so bad i just want to end things but i don’t have the courage to. Everyday is a fight to keep going and some days i just cry so hard that i don’t even know who i am anymore , it’s like i have to no spark no matter what i do even when im with my friends im miserable. I can’t find happiness anywhere and i just wish things would end and i would disappear because i feel pointless . On top of this overwhelming sadness i have family problems and it doesn’t help any bit more , if anything i feel more depressed everyday . i try to distract myself by playing sports and putting time into activities but i can’t even seem to stay happy when im doing that .  i just want help or tips to be happier , what do i do?
