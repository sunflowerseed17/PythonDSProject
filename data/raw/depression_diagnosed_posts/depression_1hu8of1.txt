I've been reading stories here for some time and I have realised that life isn't so easy for many people. 
The last months have been the worst of my life. I am in constant pain, I can only feel sadness. All this was caused after a break up. I hadn't realised how much I loved that person until it was too late. But it didn't matter, he never even fell in love with me. It has been really difficult for me, I miss him so much and it causes so much pain.
I can't say that I was happy before him, my life hasn't been easy. I have a toxic family and it doesn't seem I can escape it. All the members of my family are unhappy. How could I ever be happy?
I started therapy hoping it can ease the pain but I don't see any results yet. I guess it will take some time.
I think I had hope that better days would come, this is why I endured all the pain. But as I get older I don't see those days and I am losing that hope. By now I thought I would had found the person that I would spend my life with but I am not even close to that. This was always important to me, to have this intimacy with someone.

I just wonder if it is really possible after 29 years of sadness to find happiness.
