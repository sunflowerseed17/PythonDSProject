I'm 17 years old and I'm a 12th grade student(from Philippines) I was really passionate about studying from Australia since Nursing is high demand there(I really wanted to be a nurse.) I've wanted to be a nurse since I was little and I always told my parents. They are like "Okay sure, as long as it's for your happiness, son." But I don't know what challenges I will face regarding the requirements needed to study in Australia. I searched online and most of the universities are looking for grades, And that's not all. It's either that I need a sponsor or a loan from the bank. I thought about how I would pay if my expenses when I went there were already quite a lot. How can I study if I myself have low grades from the past? I know they are hiring there but will that be enough to support myself? I'm in a state where I'm very frustrated with my life. I want to achieve my dreams but I can't because of my grades in school. I know how to speak English but I don't know if it will help me. I really want to pursue it but I also feel sorry for myself whether I can do it or My dream won't come true. I want to give up but I'm still thinking about what will happen to me. I hope someone can help me with what I should do. (I choose Australia other than any countries because I could see my opportunity there but I don't know if I can achieve it.)
