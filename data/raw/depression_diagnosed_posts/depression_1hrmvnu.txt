Ok so I was raped. The case is currently with crown prosicution service im waiting to see the outcome. Court will be long ive been told its going to be a two year fight. My case is strong I've been told there's a very good chance he's going down but the time length  This obviously pre longs healing its going to take maximum two years.  Im in threapy. This has effected me i have been diagnosed with ptsd and there are things I just can't go near sexually again which will effect intemecy. This things are 
- semen on me including my mouth
- oral sex on me. Even thinking about these things takes me back to the event there's no way I can do them

- sex will take a while to start in a new relationship given what's happened. 

 when do I disclose what's happened? Its not exactly a first date disclosure. 

Im worried men won't want me because it's too much to handle. Why would they want me when they can have a non traumatised woman. Im also sober no booze this might be an issue if they want a drinking buddy and I'm strictly no drugs especially cocaine. The drugs thing isn't rape related I just don't want to deal with a user but again could be an issue as I know many people in general do it
