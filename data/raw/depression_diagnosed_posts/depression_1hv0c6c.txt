Hi all,

I don't usually post anything online. I found out about this platform from an AI tool. I was that kind of lonely. I don't have anyone to talk to so I was talking to an AI. I don't know if being here will help me or not. I guess I can talk to some people who feel the same way. Last year was not a good year. I lost my job which although I don't care about that much. I was not feeling happy. I never do. Thought when I'll move out of the house, start earning maybe this feeling of loneliness will go away. But it never did. I have a few friends but we never talk about our feelings. They think I'm doing okay. I've had a few relationships. But none of them lasted long enough. I guess when someone gets to know the real me, they also start to hate me as much as I do. No one is ever attracted to me. I guess they know I don't have any love to give. My heart is filled with hate. I hate myself to the point that I think I deserve the pain I'm going through. I try to learn new things, make myself happy and although there are few moments of happiness, but the loneliness always creeps back in. My own parents don't understand me, even though I never blame them. Maybe this is not the way to deal with things, but I don't know anything else. There's not a single thing in this world I'm good at or which brings me joy. Although I'm don't have any suicidal thoughts but it's just hard to bear life.
