hi, i have been going to therapy for some time now and was diagnosed with major depressive disorder (mdd) and generalized anxiety disorder. i have been thinking about getting on lexapro because the depression has been bad lately. i know theres pros and cons to this so someone who is on it could tell me if its worth it or not i would greatly appreciate it
