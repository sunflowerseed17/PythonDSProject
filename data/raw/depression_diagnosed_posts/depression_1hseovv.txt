Recently I have been struggling with these immense feelings of overwhelming pain and fear about death and it's starting to make me have panic attacks. For context, I tried to commit about 3 years ago when I found out that my father had prostate cancer and a partner broke up with me. I was in a really bad place and I resulted to suicide, however, I was able to prevent me from doing it and seek the help I needed. In the long run though, I have a crippling fear of death and even when I think about when I die, I begin to get nauseous and I begin to cry even. It's always felt like a hard topic to discuss and It feels like It would never get easier, but when I look out for comfort people talk about death like it's nothing, they don't fear it as much and they almost seem comfortable with the idea of it. This never ceases to blow me away and I always wonder to myself, "I really wish I could be like that." Because I'm barely turning into an adult and I know I have many years ahead of me, but it just scares me about how un expected death can be.
