Hello all I am a psychology post grad student so basically i am here for the people who have struggled with depression at some point of their life. This is my final year and post grad research came up at first i thought of doing something very minimal and write it off but then I thought, "NO" I am in this field for 5 years so I have to make some contribution to it in return.

Here I am doing a research on finding the influence of physical activity and family support in resilience with individuals with depression.

I assure you guys i am going to publish this paper and I will approach senior authorities about my research and alter the therapeutic techniques with my results not all yeah but atleast I can help whoever I can reach out.

So if anyone of you are willing to participate in my research please let me know it would be a huge helpüôè
