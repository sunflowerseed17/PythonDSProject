So I had a very low low today and I was talking to a toxic family member. And this person started to lecture me on me, using my severe depression as an excuse and while I’m trying to defend myself, they just keep getting louder and louder so finally, I got up and left. I went home crying, and I tried to strangle myself with a cord. Thankfully, I called my sister and she help me a lot but it’s really hard when you have a toxic family member a parent who doesn’t see you and only sees what you’re doing wrong and criticizes you and makes you feel horrible like there’s something defective about you like your very existence is too much for them. And I don’t know how to feel anymore I feel like I’m in a daze. I spent the whole day off in bed crying no friends and no family around me and I just feel like I don’t know how I’m gonna get through the next year.
