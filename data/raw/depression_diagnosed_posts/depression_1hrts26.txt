I thought making music would help me get through the hardest part of my life but in reality it merely bottled up. I’m 26 turning 27 in February and I’ve been feeling weird heart pains for a good while but I’ve done nothing about it. Why would I go to a medical facility so they could just tell me I’m dying or for them to give me a million pills to take just to prolong the inevitable and increase my anxiety about living. It’s kind of fucked to think that I’m more anxious about staying alive than I am about death itself. My family is all at each others throats and my mom even moved out with my little sister because of all the bullshit that was happening at home with my oldest sister and I have no say/word in anything happening at home mainly because I work 2 jobs so I’m never home. I got in a car accident recently too that broke my nose and ribs and totaled my car so I had to drive a shitty little car that also just gave out on me in the last week so now I’m stuck driving my other sister’s car until I can save but I don’t see myself making it to the end of the year. I work out all the time as a means to escape what I’m going thru but due to working the 2 jobs I am hardly getting sleep. At most I’ll sleep 2-3 hours and I’ll sleep on my lunch breaks and I honestly believe the lack of sleep is giving me auditory hallucinations and it fucking sucks. I don’t have a SO either so I’m not leaving anyone behind if I really don’t make it to the end of the year. I wish I could take the easy way out without anyone knowing
