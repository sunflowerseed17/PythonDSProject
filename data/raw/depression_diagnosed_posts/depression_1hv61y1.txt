Me, (28y) i have some phases that i feel super irritated & depressed from nothing. Its always at the beginning of the year till march. I donâ€™t understand why i feel this way. I have everything in life, super blessed, good love life, good relationships with my family. Feeling like this makes it super hard enjoy and do the daily tasks. However, i am very unsatisfied with my job, i wanna change but its super hard step to do. I feel like stuck mentally & professionally. I almost snapped at a working superior today. Tell me, if you went trough this ?What is your thoughts on this? Should i get professional help?
