I'm sorry this is just gonna be a rant here's my sob story lol. I don't even know where to start. i had a shitty childhood, i dinnt have a good environment to succeed let alone function normally.Â  My parents are poor, they always fought, i was Verbally/physically abused by my dad, sexually assaulted by a stranger when i was 7, bullied growing up, etc you get this gist. now I'm in my early 20s just broken. all these things compounded and fucked me over, and now I'm a utter failure. i don't have anything in my life, no job, no friends, no purpose. I sleep 12-15 hours a day and just rot. I have no sort of independence. my parents still fight and i just fucking hate it. always arguing about some bullshit and my dad makes fun of me even though HE'S THE ONE WHO MADE ME LIKE THIS AND GAVE ME NO GUIDANCE OR SUPPORT WHATSOEVER. That's one of the reasons I sleep because I don't wanna hear them arguing and ruining my mental state. And I'm literally alone, I have no real friends that I could turn to for help, they just use me as a source of entertainment and they don't care. I also have crippling anxiety. I rarely step out of the house and when I do I feel like i'm being judged by others. I know I have personal responsibility for what I've become but I was dealt with a shitty card. I want to change but I just don't have any support. I'm so alone, I want to turn my life around. the only copes I have are gaming and calisthenics. I just wanna be happy and normal.
