For the longest time I have been depressed. All through my teen years I dealt with heavy suicidal idealization. Not to the point of attempting but damn near it. Around 17-18, I had some stuff come up that pushed me past my “functional” point and caused me to stay in my bed, and rot for a few weeks straight. I really lost myself there. In a few days I’ll be 21 and I feel mostly better. I don’t want to actively kill myself but I definitely just don’t want to “exist” if that makes sense. I just autopilot day to day life.

Today I was hanging out with some coworkers, who I feel like we’re friends. We were having a decent time, but the whole time I just felt off, like I was actively pushing myself. After a certain point I just snapped inside and kinda turned off. That brought back all of those thoughts, especially after we all left. Almost a stomach twisting emptiness. Even after having a good time I go back on things said and worry if I fucked up, or I’ll take a joke (directed to me) by a coworker I admire, and turn it into this soul crushing experience. And that makes me feel like our relationship is a sham and not what I thought it to be.

I’m really, really exhausted of dealing with whatever this is. I can tell that it’s baked deep into my roots and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to fully overcome this. I really want to try medication but I am afraid

My life feels still and I want out
