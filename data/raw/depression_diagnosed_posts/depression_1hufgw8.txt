I've not been able to access therapy but I am almost sure that I have been suffering from depression since 2019. I had an attempt in the winter of 2019 but obviously it was not successful. Suicidal thoughts have stayed with me, but I have not tried again. 

 Every time I make a mistake, no matter how small, I consider the option of killing myself. 

Now, I'll probably go study abroad in September and I'm afraid that at the slightest opportunity I get or something goes wrong, I'll decide to kill myself. I'll be almost on my own and my family won't be the ones to find my body. I have decided to stay for them, but now that I am going away, I am afraid of what I might do.
