A 35F, I find myself feeling lost and left behind in life. It's been two years since my mother passed away from cancer, and since then, I've felt an overwhelming sense of isolationâ€”no family to connect with and no friends to lean on. In fact, I haven't had a single friend since 2022, which leaves me feeling completely alone. 

I also don't know how to drive, which makes my life feel even more constricted. My job is a minimum wage position that barely makes ends meet, and I'm struggling under the weight of a significant amount of student debt. I attempted to seek help through therapy, but unfortunately, the therapist I was paired with seemed distracted and not fully present during our sessions, leaving me feeling unheard and more hopeless than before. 

Every day feels like a battle to find meaning and purpose in my life, and I often wonder how I ended up in this situation. I felt compelled to share this because I have no one to talk to about what I'm experiencing.
