Growing up with a parent who was planning for the world to end, I never expected to make it to 18. Here I am at 26 and I don’t know how much longer I can keep existing in this world. I feel so disconnected with everything and everyone around me. I want to be held by someone but there is no one here to hold me. I feel safest when curled under my blankets but my mind torments me with endless thoughts of death. I don’t know how much longer I want to live.  

I’ve struggled with depression since I was a child. I use to hide and cry for hours on end. 

I usually spend my holidays alone because my family doesn’t like the fact that I’m queer. I’ve tried to build chosen families and don’t have the social cues it takes to find the right people. I thought I would feel better with the holidays being over but I don’t. I can’t get out of this hole. 

I don’t think I belong anywhere. Especially in the US. I want to move but don’t have the funds needed to do so and it might be too late for that now.
