This is a throw away account so it hopefully doesn’t get traced back to me. 

But I can do this anymore I’ve been with this girl for a few years now and we’ve had issues, hell who can say they haven’t ever right? But she cheated left me for a guy while I was out of town working came back started packing so on. Ending up back together she blamed being depressed on me leaving for work. Mind you I was the only working adult with there being one child in the home. So I quit my job did some work around our town and things seemed to be looking up but I went from 80k a year to maybe 20k at first so money got real tight got a slightly better job now but still maybe pushing 40k we got bills to be paid and I used to just throw her money pay everything without blinking an eye because I love her. Every other week maybe sometimes more she talks about wanted to end her life. I talk her down as best as I can. This happened again a few days ago. She busted into the bathroom right as I was getting out of the shower saying if the kiddo wasn’t here she would have done it. Looks like she’d been crying so I try and talk to her and she walks off. Get dressed go find her try to find a way to help with these thoughts and problems and she just basically said if I can’t figure out a solution by now I never will she’s said all she can say. So I know money being tight is an issue I know our house being messy is an issue but I feel like part of it is she’s trying to keep me hooked. Trying to make sure I don’t leave but I feel like she wants me around just until she finds someone else to take over for me. She’s been secretive with her phone. Been getting random calls at night that she doesn’t answer I assume it’s because I’m there. She went to go to her car to talk on the phone with someone recently for hours only reason I knew what she was doing was because I was already outside when she came out and just said to me “I’m going to make a phone call and clean my car”. But if I walk out of the room with my phone in hand I’m being secretive and why can’t I leave my phone when I walk out. Like I’ve had thoughts of ending my own life and a long term buddy of mine talked me out of it more times than I can give him credit some he doesn’t even know about. But recently I haven’t wanted to bother him. I a man I can’t have feeling. My job is to provide and protect. But I feel like I’m going to lose this battle soon. I’m 18k in CC debt because of the fact that I went from making good money to next to nothing. She complains about owing like 2k-3k in CCs but never once asked me about mine. I took a loan for a truck awhile ago at a real bad time been making my payments just by the skin of my teeth and I don’t want to go to the next life but honestly in this home I feel more alone than anything and I don’t know how much longer I can do it for. 🤷🏻‍♂️

Sorry I know it’s a big of a read and my spelling and grammar is a problem I just needed to get this out.
