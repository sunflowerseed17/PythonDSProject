I am desperate for a job. I don’t want to live with my family anymore. I live with my grandma and she is dying. I have 2 toddlers and we are too much for her. She hasn’t said that but it’s just obvious. I don’t blame her. She shouldn’t have to live with me and my 2 crazy kids. It’s like I can’t enjoy life because all I think about is wanting to get a job and move to our own place. I have applied to dozens and dozens of jobs. I do have an interview tomorrow so that’s good. I am autistic (not an excuse) and it’s difficult for me to talk to people. I’ve had a couple of interviews and I was just awkward and never heard back. 

I am trying really hard to appreciate and enjoy the moment because I know I’ll regret if I don’t. I just really want to move. It seems so impossible with how expensive life is now.
