33f for context.  I’ve had severe depression since I was about 6 years old.  Despite being a therapist myself and being in and out of therapy I still struggle every single day to make it to the next one.  Sure there have been good times and happier years, and I still return to this state of suicidal depression.  I have tried to kill myself on three separate occasions over the past ten years, the last two landed me in a hospital and then psych ward.  I had to fight to keep my therapist license, and I wonder why I’m even trying anymore.  I’ve bought heroine a few months ago (which is my end game choice) and it’s just sitting in my drawer at home.  I’m confident it’s enough to kill me with, but I’m just trying to stay alive for my family.  I know they’d be distraught if/when I kill myself and I just don’t know how to knowingly put them through that.  I’ve made videos to all of them explaining as much as I can about my decision and I’ve left instructions for my affairs in my living will.  I just can’t seem to get better and I’m pretty sure this is the year I will cease to exist.  I’ve had two patients commit suicide this past year and I’ve helped their families a little with the process.  

Not really looking for comfort anymore or reassurance.  Just venting in a way to get myself more used to the idea of not being here so that I can commit finally.
