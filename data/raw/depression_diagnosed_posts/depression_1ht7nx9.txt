I was just in my first year of college and my parents forced me to take an engineering course. They said I should just try and I could switch courses if I couldn't do it, but now that I've switched, I'm ready. There were so many problems, especially with enrolling, and I was so stressed out because of the change in the subject schedule, and then there were different rooms that were far away to walk to, and I didn't know what to do.
