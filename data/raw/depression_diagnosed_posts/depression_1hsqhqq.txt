I have been feeling super extra depressed the past two months. I am struggling hard core and I don't think anyone knows what to do to help me. I am feeling passively suicidal. I would never do it and I don't have a plan or intention, but the depression has gotten that bad. I am on meds and have been on them for awhile. They have worked great for me up until now. I scheduled with my therapist and my meds doctor. 

I'm just looking for support. I am going through a rough time in life and I'm catastrophizing everything. It feels like I won't be happy again.
