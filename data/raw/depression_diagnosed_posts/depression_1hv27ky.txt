I feel so stuck right now. 

I've been married about a year to someone I've been with for over eight years. I tell her I love her every day but I'm too much of a coward to admit to myself that I never have. I only married her because it was the path of least resistance. I am quite successful in my career, live in a nice apartment, have friends, and life seems to be going quite well from the outside. I am miserable, though. I am so scared of conflict that I never fight for what I actually want. I hate myself deeply because of this fact. I've always been so scared of conflict that I've either lied and told people what they want to hear so that it didn't result in me getting in a fight with them. I had a traumatic childhood, and both my mother and sister are regularly in and out of psychiatric wards. I think about killing myself often, but know I wouldn't have the guts to do it, like I haven't had the guts to make any hard decision in my life. I've been accepting the wants of others so long that I think I've actually forgotten how to want anything on my own, and so I believe in nothing except that I hate seeing others suffer. There is something down there, deep inside, that wants to get out and live, but it's wrapped in so many layers of shame, embarrassment and cowardice that it has no way to get out. I don't know why I posted this except that I needed to tell someone, and I am too embarrassed to say this out aloud, even to my therapist.
