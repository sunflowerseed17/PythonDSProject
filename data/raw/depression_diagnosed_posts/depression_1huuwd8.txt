I am in my early 30s.. never really had issues with severe loneliness, depression before but its been a hard couple months. Im in a spiral and cant seem to be motivated to do anything, have no energy.. trying my best to get up everyday and be present for my kids. My husband moved our family (us & 3 kids) halfway across the country about 3 years ago.. away from family and friends for a job that pays more than he was getting before but still not enough to be financially worry free. We bought a house when we moved here and it used to be very affordable until our taxes have significantly increased our payments about $400 more monthly and counting.. So now we have this regret of buying, moving, its all getting so much. All he does is work, if he gets sick more than a couple days it hits hard financially. Im currently taking care of our kids and baking on the side that doesn’t generate more than a couple hundred dollars in a month, if that.. we have not made real connections out here , other than quick acquaintances here and there, but nothing like our years of friendships back home and our family. So the loneliness, especially the holidays that just passed and the thought of “working your whole life just to pay bills, still be in debt, don’t get to see the rest of the world” has been so depressing to me. I understand there are others who have a harder life, i really do but I just need to know how people get themselves out of negative thoughts and situation.
