Just a few weeks ago, before Christmas, I was planning on killing myself. I was ready. I was going to wait till the weekend, but I had to go to school first. But during school something changed. My friend told me she was suicidal. Now I knew she was depressed, but I didn't know how bad it was. She told me that she had already attempted in a similar way to what I was  going to do and it made me think of how sickening it would feel to live without her. It made me want to live. To keep her with me, and to keep me with her. I can't go a day without talking to her now, because she is my everything currently. I told her as long as I'm living, she has to stay with me. And my love for this person is stronger than my want to escape.
