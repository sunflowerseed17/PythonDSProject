I am a 28 year old female and have suffered with my mental health since around 12 years old.

I have tried various medications but still find that they don’t work for me so 12 months ago I came off my fluoxetine and only now take propranolol for my raging anxiety.

Long story short I hate being alive and I can’t see I’ll ever not feel this way with feeling like this since before I was even a teenager. I try my best to stay positive and keep busy but then that makes me tired and in turn even more depressed. I do not feel well in my head at all and fighting against wanting to end my life everyday is getting too much for me and I seem to have developed a weird attraction towards danger too. 

My friends and family notice when these thoughts come over me as I go blank and can’t even hold a conversation but I can’t upset them by telling them how I feel so I just brush it off as being tired.


I just don’t know what to do anymore and I do believe there just isn’t help for some people (some people being me)
