I’ve struggled with depression on and off for years but I would say for awhile it’s been good. Recently though, not so much. My partner ended up in the hospital with an illness and has been fighting this since November 14th. We live together so the place has felt so lonely without him. I’ve surprised myself with how strong i’ve been able to be for him through it all. On top of this, my sister had major health issues who I am also close with, I’ve had to deal with illegal landlords doing illegal things on my own, living far away from my family when i need them most, working a job that i hate and doesn’t pay enough for myself, and taking care of our cat. I don’t want to make this about myself because it’s not about me. All I want for him to be better and it kills me with such a long road it’s been. I’m so emotionally exhausted and burnt out with trying to stay strong for him I have no motivation for anything else in my life. Our room is disgusting and needs to be cleaned because of me but I have zero motivation to do anything about it. I am not cooking and eating out all the time. I am not cleaning anything. I barely have motivation to get out of bed. It kills me that I’m going back into this state of depression when it’s not about me and I have to stay strong for my partner. I feel so selfish feeling down when he’s stuck in the hospital but it’s all just so much. I have adhd as well which contributes to my depression. I can’t handle too many things at once because of that and it’s all just been a lot. I am wondering if anybody has any advice on what to do? It would be very helpful. Thank you for listening to me ramble if you’ve made it this far.
