Hello. I used to be very pretty and happy with my life. Then the surgeon botched me without a reason. We didn't even discuss a lot before surgery. I felt rushed. He only said, “it's gonna look perfect, I have a good plan for you”. I feel ashamed for trusting him. My nose looks ugly now and everyone confirms it. I don't know why he did it to me. I don't leave my house anymore. I do not have friends anymore and I used to be a very social person. I tried therapy and medication. Nothing helps. He ruined my life I don't know how to live with it. I was fooled for money. Disgusting. Please someone help me. I don't know what to do. I'm not living, in surviving with a botched nose right now.
