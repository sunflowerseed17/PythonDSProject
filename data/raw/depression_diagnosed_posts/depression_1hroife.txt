"There is help out there" has to be the most dismissive thing ever, cause when actually asked about it, noone has a clear answer.

I don't have enough money for therapists (and I envy those who does), and neither are there many quality therapists where I am from. Can't even connect with people over here because of conflicting views and goals.

I just wish people would stop deluding others into believing that there is help just because they were privileged enough to get it, not everyone's circumstance is the same.
