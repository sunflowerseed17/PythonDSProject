My life is a mess....I don't see how it could get better, I'm 17 and my in my whole life I just suffered by being bullied 12 years by my classmates, I don't have an idea of what I'm going to do in the future, I don't want kids nor a relationship because that will only create more sadness, depression and drama that I hate, I don't want to talk to anyone, I had been in my house for weeks and didn't went out, I have a verry bad social anxiety and I always want to make others very happy by helping them, I don't know why, I probably have ADHD because I don't seem to care about anything and I move all the time in my bed, I can't seem to study for school because of my lack of motivation I got...my life has been like this since more than 12 years, because I have an abusive father who forced things on me, saying to me that I'm skinny as a skeleton and not eating enough, he would beat me to eat the food with bread and yelling all the time why I'm playing on my phone...It was very hard to say those things here...I'm dealing with depression for a couple of years now and I can't seem it getting any better I'm scared I will probably kill myself but who knows......a couple of months ago I had cut my arm with a knife because I wanted attention from my family, I feel like life is pointless if I would fall down the stairs I won't do anything, like, protecting myself with the arms, I would just fall down... that's how bad my state is..shit...I may even have suicide thoughts now after creating this post...I know that there are a lot of people in my situation but that doesn't help me, I don't know why, it should be better for me if I would know that there are people experiencing the same things I experience...nothing works for me, I have such a bad luck in everything...I think I've had enough and want to end it all, the only thing that is keeping me here is my family and friends (I have like, 2 friend in my entire life, I don't seem to care if I have more, I can only think of 2....) so, thanks for reading this, have a good day/night and remember that if you have these thoughs just think about your close ones and how they will feel if you committed suicide....I want to do it but I don't want to in the same time, keep yourself safe!
