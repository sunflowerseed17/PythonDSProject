Well, I am not quite sure how to begin this text. In reality, I am unsure about anything.
I am Brazilian, not that it matters to you, the reader. I feel as though I am dying inside. Nothing makes sense anymore.

Some people claim I am highly intelligent. Liars! My impostor syndrome might make my assertions seem biased, but I am nothing more than a foolish young individual gradually destroying myself—physically, metaphysically, and mentally. I cannot navigate life. I have no faith in anything, and I am incapable of forcing myself to have it.

I used to be a cheerful, altruistic child, often referred to as an "angel." However, a series of events cast me into an abyss. At the bottom of this pit, I discovered a trapdoor leading to an endlessly deep fall, devoid of any prospect of return. I try to be good, but I do not even know what "good" means or if it truly exists.

I am unattractive, overweight, and frequently plagued by allergies that give me a perpetually sickly appearance. No amount of fitness training has ever succeeded in boosting my self-esteem. I have tried. My essence—if such a thing exists—feels shattered. I refuse to numb myself with the cultural opiates of modernity, though I often think life within Plato’s cave might be preferable; after all, a life devoid of thought seems sweeter. Yet, I cannot stop thinking.

Since my grandmother's passing in 2022, everything has unraveled. I am unsure whether life lost its purpose, meaning, significance, or simply the only thing that made it joyful: having someone who loved me and cared about what I did.

I do not know why I should continue living, but neither do I wish to die.

I cannot find my place socially; I believe I am unpleasant. Others claim the opposite, but the reason is simple: I exist to be used.
