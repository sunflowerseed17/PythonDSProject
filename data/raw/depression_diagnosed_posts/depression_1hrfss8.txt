When I was 23 I was genuinely happy for the first time in my life.

I was interning for a known company in an industry that I always wanted to be in, I thought that this would *finally* be my big break and I'd never have to struggle with employment again...

A year later, I was getting rejected from jobs despite being qualified and despite having a known company on my resume.

Fast forward to today and I haven't worked in 2 and a half years.  
I'm 30 years old, still living with my mum and on unemployment benefits.

I'm so eternally depressed and don't know how to get out of this situation besides suicide.  
I don't leave the house anymore, I have no friends and no future.

All I ever wanted was an average wage so I could rent my own apartment, and hopefully find a girl who loves me the way I love her.

Lately, my heart aches with emotional pain and I can't take it much longer.
