I am so numb I am so empty I have so much physical and mental pain. My head is hurting so much, my back is trying to kill me.  200 thoughts a minute. Haven't ever in 29 years been a functioning human. 16 years of isolation and if I look at computer screen or video games it makes me sick. I am so overweight but because of depression and having tried gym without no result I can't even fix it. They're telling me I'm useless and should kill myself. Loneliness is finally setting in I could cope other years but this and last year have been living hell. I just want this to end...
