Hey there, so im a 18 year old boy currently studying, i recently got diagnosed with Unipolar Depression and i have been laid off therapy since the idea of it completely ruined my mental. recently i have been having troubles being apathetic towards everything after i had alot of bad things happen to me at once, currently im in the midst of a relationship thats about to end (4 years and my childhood friend) shes been the only one thats really understood me and i fear as tho i will never feel happy again, im constantly thrown off on it and i dont really know what to do, im not particularly super sad about it but i feel a sense of hopelessness and sorrow whenever i go through with my day to day life. I know that stuff like this isnt uncommon but i feel like everyone that has gone through it says that everything gets better at one point, it hasnt and i dont think it ever will. 

  
Are there any tips or recommendations on how to deal with this? does it really get better and if so, does it build up slowly or just hit you randomly.
