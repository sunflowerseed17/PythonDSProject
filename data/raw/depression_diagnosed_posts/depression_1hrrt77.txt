I hate this life. I’ll never understand why I was dealt this miserable hand. I don’t see much reason to continue, other than the fact that I haven’t traveled as much as I want, but other than that there’s nothing here for me. I’ll most likely be alone forever. If I somehow find a partner, I wouldn’t want to burden them with my issues and insecurities. I’ll always feel less than and no good to this world.
