I am so depressed and all I do is play games to cope with life and i cant handle it, because now even games i play are boring and im losing all my motivation to do anything and im never happy 

I feel like giving up, i already have because every day i dread waking up, and every night i dread sleeping because its all night terrors, i have major ptsd , I dont know what to do anymore, this is very bad ive hit rock bottom, i am very disconnected from reality . without a game in my hand i lose my mind and now i am losing intrest even in my coping skill, i cant do it anymore i am being haunted and the devil is trying to do his worst and I keep praying and praying. When will my prayers be answered , i lost myself long ago now im just watching my life happen but i have no motivation to move or get up, and people are so mean and it really gets to me. this world is ice cold, and turned me into this. I feel terrible and powerless and i just dont wanna go on its too painful for my heart to take
