Hi everyone,

I’m writing here because I feel like I’ve been stuck in a cycle of pain and confusion for most of my life, and I’m hoping to find someone who understands or has been through something similar.

I grew up in a very traumatic environment. My dad knowingly gave my family HIV, and after that, he took his own life. The fallout was devastating. My mom became very ill, and we had to move in with my grandparents, where she faced verbal abuse, but I was the one who suffered physical and verbal abuse. During that time, I became my mom’s emotional punching bag, which left me feeling scared, responsible for others, and deeply insecure.

On top of that, relatives constantly reminded my mom and me of how “bad” things turned out, blaming us for things we couldn’t control. It left me feeling worthless and ashamed.

2 years ago, I got into a long-distance relationship. At first, I thought it was what I needed someone who could understand me and who also shared the same health status as me. But over time, I realized how manipulative he was. He made me question my worth, my decisions, and even who I was as a person. It took me a long time, but I finally had some time to myself to figure things out and decided to leave him. While I know I deserve so much better, having someone with the same health status had become my priority, and I had convinced myself I couldn’t do better.

After graduating, I burned out completely. It took me nine months to even leave the house and find a job. When I finally did, I worked nonstop for two years, pushing myself beyond my limits. Then, I lost my job, and for the past eight months, I’ve been stuck at home with no income. It feels like my youth is slipping away, and I don’t know how to get back on track.

I’ve been distracting myself with binge-watching shows and imagining a better life, but deep down, I feel like I’m wasting my potential. I’m scared, anxious, and paralyzed by my insecurities. Even though I dream of a brighter future, I don’t know how to make it real.
Has anyone else experienced something similar? How did you overcome it? I’d appreciate any advice, resources, or even just kind words to help me feel less alone.

Thank you for reading.
