I [23M] have been struggling with loneliness and depression for a while now. Recently, I felt so desperate for any kind of human connection that I hired a prostitute, even though it wasn’t something I ever thought I’d do. I did reseaech ans found a site that looks legit. I talked with a woman and she came to my house. I paid $450, and while I stepped away to use the bathroom, she left with my money. Didn't even do have the slightest interaction.

Now, I feel completely shattered. It feels like I can’t even pay for someone to be around me, and it’s hard not to feel like a failure. So embarassing. I don’t even know where to turn or how to cope with this emptiness. I feel stuck, and I’m not sure how much more I can take.

I have been talking with a therapist and (third person) and I struggle to even talk about these kind of things. I feel like the conversations are so basic and pointless. I feel that I am one step away from ending it at this point.
