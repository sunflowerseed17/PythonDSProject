Last year was a really rough year for me. I’ve been struggling with depression for almost 10 years now, and there are moments where I know how to handle it. I’ve tried it all, I usually try to see the positive side of things, but lately, whenever I get sad, I get so sad and my mind wanders automatically to just ending it. For a while, the thought of it scared me so much and I never did anything for actually doing it. But tonight, my head keeps bringing it up on loop. I feel like I’m about to make a really stupid decision, but my heart is so so so so tired. I just want to rest. I feel like I can’t deal with it anymore. 

Yesterday I told my family about my plans of moving out and to try to be independent and start to provide for myself. I was really exited and looking forward to it. They took it so badly, I started the year alone and crying in my room. Today, no one spoke to me, even though I’m very sick, and they went to a family reunion without me. Tonight, they all just came back, didn’t ask if i was feeling better or how I was doing. They just went upstairs to sleep and left me all alone in the living room, by myself. 

I feel so guilty, but those plans really exited me. Now, that I clearly do not have the support of my family, I feel like I have nothing left anymore. I keep asking myself what am I doing here, anyways. I feel so lonely and like I cannot reach anyone. 

It’s just that I can’t handle my sadness anymore. I want to rest.
