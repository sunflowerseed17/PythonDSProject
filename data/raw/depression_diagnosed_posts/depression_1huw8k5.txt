My parents somehow got pousoned by media propaganda and saying because I got empathy that I must be killed by woke virus. It feels like I lost them and at best I can only get scolded by them if I try to talk. When I tried to talk with my dad about it he slapped me while I was crying saying he regrets having me. I don't know where they got so much hate from.
