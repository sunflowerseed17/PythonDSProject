I got fired about a month ago. I’ve never been fired before, no one had discussed anything with me prior, and even said I was doing well. I was there for maybe two months and still “training”.. I’ve worked in the field for two years at other places and never had any issues EVER. I feel like such a deadbeat. They gave me a lame excuse that was clearly made up because as said prior I have experience in the field and NEVER been told it was wrong. I also took a break from the field for a year before getting back into it. I’m depressed. I’m upset. I feel like I let everyone down. I’d never been fired in my life. It was the vet field. It was a small clinic where like the whole family just about worked. The husband and wife owned it. The wife is a veterinarian. Very clique like. The owner would literally have other employees pick her kids up and chauffeur them around.
