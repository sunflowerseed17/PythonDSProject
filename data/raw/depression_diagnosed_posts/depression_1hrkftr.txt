My best friend Mel, and I have been close for 11 years. Both of us struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts. I am now getting better, but for my sanity I try to avoid topics of self-harm and suicide. It drives me to panic attacks and feeling suicidal myself.  
Mel has only been gettingÂ *worse*. She feels suicidal so often that I find it suffocating to be around her. I try to help but find it very difficult to listen to her venting. She self harms often and it breaks my heart but I can't convince her to stop (obviously). Her family is abusive and even though she asked to go to therapy, they just don't seem to care.  
Recently Mel has been saying and doing stuff that genuinely scares the shit out of me. For instance, not long ago she said she would set herself on fire at night. This was over text and I couldn't drive to her place. I was ready to call the ambulance if I needed to, but she didn't do it and later apologized. When I talk about the future with her, such as future jobs or possible financial problems, she says things like "That probably doesn't even matter because I'll be dead by then."

I don't mean to sound ungrateful for her. She is my best friend and I love her but I just cannot handle this. I'm not mentally stable myself. I try to listen to her vent but I can't handle the talk about suicide and self harm.

At this point, I'm so scared she will actually kill herself. What do I do?
