was diagnosed 12/31/24. in the process of telling everyone and wondering if I should tell my work supervisor that I have breast cancer. the alternate is telling her that I was diagnosed with a disease that will require surgery and ongoing treatment, so I will sometimes have last minute appts and in general just have to take more PTO this year. 

part of me wants to keep it vague bc I don’t want her to worry (my prognosis is good); the other part just feels like she’ll have more understanding if I disclose the full diagnosis. 

how have you all handled this?
