24F. yeah you read that right, I was diagnosed with stage 1 IDC +++ 2.6cm tumor at 24 years old, which is ~5% chance. I just got my treatment plan today from surgery. 6 rounds of chemo, surgery, then radiation therapy. need to talk to oncology next week for finer details on chemo. 

in my appointment, they said some of the statistics won’t be reflective of me bc they often don’t do studies on patients under 30.. bc it’s that rare. 

what a blow. I’m so bummed about chemo. I know it’s the least of my worries but losing my hair, having to talk to fertility to discuss egg retrieval, the nausea.. then possibly losing a breast, possibly having menopause symptoms. I’m trying to focus on right now rather than the hypotheticals and tell myself “it is what it is, as long as I live, which I will.”

but the truth is, I’m grieving so much. my 20s are supposed to be good - I’ve been more active than ever, traveling before I have even more adult responsibilities, trying to develop professionally. I have to give up so much of my current lifestyle, and I feel alone in this. 

I’ll get through this, but at what cost? I’m hoping this will all just feel like a blip in the timeline. to the survivors - does it feel like a blip in the timeline?

if anyone has any recommendations for support groups for young cancer patients, please share. thanks for reading
