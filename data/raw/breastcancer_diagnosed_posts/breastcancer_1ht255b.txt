How long do I need to sleep propped up? I am 4 days post DMX to flat. I don't see a time line in my post op instructions for how long I need to sleep with my back at 30Â° I should have asked my surgeon yesterday when she called to tell me my pathology showed I achieved PCR - but my mind went blank. Now it's the weekend and I'm asking y'all if I need to worry about sliding down the wedge and ending up flat on my back?
