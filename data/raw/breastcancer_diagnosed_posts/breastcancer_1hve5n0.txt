I am needing to get a bra for after my upcoming double mastectomy. Or maybe more than just one-how many will I need? Do I need different types of bras? How long will I wear it? Should I get one with drain pockets? Should it be a front closure? 

Any suggestions you can give will be very much appreciated.
