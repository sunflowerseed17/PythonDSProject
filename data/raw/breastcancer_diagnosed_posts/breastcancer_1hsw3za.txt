Sooo, it's been about a year and a half since my DXM. I'm still in treatment (and more than likely will be for life ... stage iv, HER2+) so I didn't have the opportunity for reconstruction. It's been such a whirlwind, and I have been completely dissociated from my body for way too long. I'm going on a beach destination family vacation next month and am in a panick. The sun, the sand, the water ... used to be my go-to downtime. Now, all that translates to rashes, germs and infections. Do I wear a bathing suit? Do I need prosthetics? Do they make suits with them built in? Am I going to get sick from the drinking/shower water because my immune system is weak? I don't want any of the focus to be on my (dis)comfort, not even for a second. It's a birthday celebration for my BIL. I need to get all this figured out asap. Any advice?
