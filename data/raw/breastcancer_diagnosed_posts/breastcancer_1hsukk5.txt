Triple-positive pleomorphic lobular, finished 6 rounds of TCHP, currently having \~2 clinic visits a day to get ready for surgery next week.

I am so sick of initialing forms acknowledging everything that can go wrong.  I am frustrated with statistics of how things can come back and why they would be my fault for making bad decisions.  I am tired of telling my parents I'm fine when I'm super anxious and overwhelmed but just don't want them to worry.

  
Please: tell me there's at least one way this can all go well.  There must be stories of things not going horribly wrong, folks with few, if any, side effects, and returning back to a zesty, honest, and confident life?
