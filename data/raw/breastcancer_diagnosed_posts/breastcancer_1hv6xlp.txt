Hi my mom 69 was diagnosed with invasive duct carcinoma November 24. She had lumpectomy first week of December. No lymph nodes blessed. And clean margins. Stage 2 er and pr positive her negative with onco score 43. Have the first oncologist appointment Wednesday. 
I am nervous. What should I expect? My mom has a lot of underlying illnesses scared she will not do well with radiation and/or chemo 
Never only child here thank you
