When I first got the game, I liked her way before her redemption arc, even with all the mean things she says to your character. 

I’ve dealt with girls like that irl but never crushed on them even if I found them physically attractive. Maybe I’ve grown to like mean girls. 

There’s something very intriguing about a girl that is really mean to you, but secretly would give you a chance, and the fun of trying to win her over.
