hello, i was wondering if anyone else has any tips or experience with dealing with a specific symptom of (high-functioning) depression i’ve never been so good at articulating. i’ve never been one to be too on-the-go, and always love my time at home resting, watching TV, and playing video games. since getting this depression all i’ve wanted to do is immerse myself in a show or a game and forget about reality for even 2 hours. however, since ive lost my interest in a lot of these activities (some of which can be related to depression but ive genuinely lost interest in games as i’ve aged), i find myself in a dilemma. i play games for half an hour but i don’t enjoy it, but i do it anyway. i feel the need to escape but i physically can’t make myself watch TV or whatever since it just doesn’t feel fun. and this leads me to count down the hours of a day and also realise that im barely doing anything when im by myself. i guess, i am drawn to the idea of detachment but i cant engross myself anymore in another reality, leading me in a state of limbo and almost anxiety of wanting to do things and getting nothing done :( pls help if anything relates!
