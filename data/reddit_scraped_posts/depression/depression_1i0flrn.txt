Hey everyone, I’m a Grade 11 student and I recently got a passing line of 7 in one of my classes. From what I understand, if you get a line of 7 in any class, you're not eligible for honors, even until Grade 12, for year-end awards.

I’m considering switching to a different strand for next year, but the new strand doesn’t have the same course I got a 7 in. Will this rule still apply to me, even though I won’t be taking that course anymore? I’m a bit worried it could still affect my eligibility for honors at the year-end awards, even if I’m not in the same subject area.

If anyone has experience with this or knows how it works, I’d really appreciate your advice! Thanks!
