I struggle with depression no matter what. But during winter I have triple depression. Regular, holiday and SAD. These past 2 winters I have been taking care of myself better then I have in years. Eating right,socializing and keeping busy. I use a sad lamp too but it all doesn't work I feel just as bad as when I wasn't doing everything right. It honestly very scary and I feel like I can't control it. Im only 25, I have alot of winters left in my life. I just don't know how many more I will live through. Is there any alternatives besides the regular things people recommend? Or out of the box things people tried.
