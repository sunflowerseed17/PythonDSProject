I'm 16m and my life feels empty. I don't know how else to explain it. I've been a Christian my whole life but recently I've started to questions if God is real. I started to seek answers in the Bible but I just felt like it wasn't filling enough if that makes sense. I don't really know what to do about it anymore. I broke down crying one night and my mom found me in my bathroom. I told her how i wasn't happy with my life and I didn't know what to  do. A couple days later she mentioned a counselor to help me and I was fine with that but she never ended up doing anything about it. That part kind of pisses me off. Like my feeling weren't validated and she thought it was some sort of one night thing. I've been feeling this way for a while and only said anything because she caught me crying. She asked me if I had ever thought of hurting myself and I nodded, saying I was sorry. I have cut myself and there are scars and I hate that. My parents haven't noticed then and I haven't brought them up. I never wanted to do something like that but when my mental got bad cutting myself kind of took the edge off in a way. Now soccer stuff is starting back and I don't want to play for obvious reasons, but my mom says I have to get a job if I don't. She keeps telling me that she's upset with me not playing but it's my choice and she'll support it. I don't think she does but it's whatever. It's just the pressure of getting a job, maintaing straight A's, and dealing with college stuff starting soon is a lot. I don't know where to go from here and I don't want to tell her again. Please help
