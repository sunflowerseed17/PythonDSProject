ADHD is pretty stressful to bear, my mind constantly drowning in a flood of thoughts and whatever that I never really get to achieve "inner peace". I tried meditation, in a quiet calm area, but all that did was amplify the thoughts in my head since there was more headroom for them to go louder.


But miraculously one day. After a long day at the bowling alley and arcade with my family. We were tired and stopped by at a local restaurant to eat dinner. When I sat down and waiting for the food, I noticed something peculiar, my mind was.. actually quiet for once? I dont get the rush of random thoughts that I usually get. And mind you this was amidst the chaotic environment of what you would expect from a restaurant, the loud laughing of adults nearby, the crying of someone's baby, the loud noises coming from the ipads of the kids at the corner. It feels counter intuitive, and I dont take any adhd meds, so I dont know how it happened, it felt like a movie scene where all the background noises fade to a distant blur, and for once I could think clearly, it felt so amazing! I've been to other loud environments in the past but why has it only happened in this restaurant at this very specific moment?
