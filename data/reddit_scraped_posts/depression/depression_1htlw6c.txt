sorry but did he think he would actually pull off bringing ciara to the house with hannah there? he literally acts like a dick to hannah in front of ciara then says “i need to do damage control to make sure this doesn’t mess up stuff with ciara” then goes to hannah and TRIES to cry and then tells ciara it was amazing and expects her to just forget everything she saw lol??

Update: finished the season and am watching winter house watching luke play coy “i’m so oblivious a girl could be standing in front of me naked i wouldn’t even know she liked me” BYEEEEE
