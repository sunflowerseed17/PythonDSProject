I have mild depression and was working on it with a therapist and psychiatrist as I was overwhelmed with.. life. There was positive progress in every aspect of my life for a few years until things didn't work out with my recent job and unfortunately, I had to quit for my mental health. I spent a few months grieving over it as my career and job have been everything to me. It feels tough to get back up after hitting rock bottom this time. Maybe I'm just tired of falling and getting back up so many times, now, I want to rest. 

However, I know that if I don't get back up, I'll be too comfortable here, affecting everything I worked hard to improve on - family, romantic, relationships, friendships and most importantly, loving myself.

I'm pushing myself to pursue hobbies to find joy and motivate myself as I work to get a new job. It's really hard but I have to keep reminding myself everything will be okay. Every new day feels tougher than the previous one. 

Can't get myself to reach out and rebuild relationships with ex-coworkers whom I had a good relationship with, it's also tough to reach out to my friends to have a good social life. All I can do every day is remind myself to have positive thoughts and shift my mindset.

Negative thoughts are slowly taking over and it's got so much power over my mind. Negative thoughts are scary.
