It is a new year and I am already proving to be more of a nuisance to society than anything else. My work productivity continues to be low. I have been effectively sidelined at work, if that makes any sense. Ever since my close colleagues have left due to mismanagement, I have been reassigned to just writing documentation, rather than being involved in software design. I also have a fear of disappointing everybody when I am not able to fulfill a promise. I still struggle with binge eating and I regained 5 pounds again. I have to lose as much weight as I can before the end of January or else I will be subjected to some incredible fat shaming by my relatives. I just feel extremely lost. I am about to turn 30 without a partner. I feel trapped and a burden. I am a nobody when I think about it. I really am nothing.
