Hello everyone, I am a 29 year old man in the USA. Currently I have a few disabilities such as generalized dystonia, occipital neuralgia and am mostly blind in my left eye. 

Over the past 4 years my health has deteriorated significantly and it's taken a great toll on my depression. I was diagnosed with MDD 4-5 years ago after a suicide attempt. I had to move into an apartment with my mom and grandma so I live in the living room. My main problem is that my disabilities prevent me from doing a lot with family and friends and I end up just staying in our apartment for days at a time. I can no longer do things I used to such as bowling, riding my motorcycle or even rollerskating, which were my main hobbies for years. 

It seems so hard to get my mentality right about the things I *can* do. I've tried medications, walking, coloring or playing my favorite video games and nothing seems to help. It's also impacted my ability to date as it seems nobody wants to date someone who is disabled and can't work.

I just need some advice on routines or things y'all do that help even a tiny bit. 

Thank you for reading.
