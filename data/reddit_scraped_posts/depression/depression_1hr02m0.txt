It’s just another year, same like every other year. I used to be optimistic about new years, it’s a miracle how time can change your perceptions. What felt good was one of my friend at 12:09 caught me off guard, as she called me up and wished me new year. I wished her back. She said May all my wishes come true this year ( very basic shit you say to each other right?), but I paused for a second to think “May all my wishes come true this year? As if this year is something different, shit is gonna be shit”. I replied to her in the most awkward way “yea. Same here, I wish the same for you too”

Every year ending season I wish “maybe this year”, and that maybe has been lingering for the past 10 years.
