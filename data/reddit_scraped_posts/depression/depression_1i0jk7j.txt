I have been wearing braces for years, my teeth literally ruin my face, I feel ugly because of this, I just got out of a depressive episode and I am feeling bad again, I've never had a partner, I would like this treatment to end already, the worst thing is that I may have to change dentists due to bad treatment:( 

My mouth makes me feel too self-conscious, every time I see a photo I start to feel terrible, I feel like never going out and doing nothing, staying asleep for a long time.
