How can you get away from things that are stored in the back of your head how I am trying to ignore these kinds of things every single day but every single day comes back it's like it's drowning me god

Dead disabled mother, ex-military medic chemical tested on Madman father Personally disabled myself disabled sister, just got told to kill myself on Christmas by my sister because she kept on calling me autistic all day wouldn't stop And then my dad breaks my wrist well kind of I would imagine it's fractured And that was just because I wouldn't split my weed with him the amount of nonsense arguments that result in major issues is insane I'm in so much mental pain it is unbearable and I am afraid to kill myself so I wouldn't but at the same time I wish I was not here it really does in some way make sense to me why some people completely snap in life  
And good lord I wish I could forget my ex I really really wish I could forget my ex Because there is nothing healthy there for anyone to be had any more and it still won't stop playing in my head I am tortured man honestly I wish I could just not exist like how would any kind of medication even help this sort of depression what do I just dull it dull the feeling and and and and live with my head in the clouds and just be numb I don't understand I don't really I wish I could pull my head out of This darkness
