I have borderline personality disorder, atypical autism, depression, ptsd and generalized (now severe) anxiety. I feel like the biggest failure in the world. I go to pharma school and I got an exam on Thursday (I think I failed my exam from last week) and I’ve been pushing through to try and study but I feel like a worthless piece of shit. My life is beyond miserable because I’m unmedicated and the amount of things I have to do (paired with the fact I feel stupid) has demotivated me. I want to kill myself. I live on the 7th floor so I can literally just do it. I’d rather die than live to see myself fail. I’ve never really failed anything before and I can’t bear it. I’m emotionally unregulated and impulsive. I’m trying so hard not to let me personality disorder make me do another rash and stupid decision that’ll affect my future. Everyday I pray I don’t wake up when I fall asleep. 

I’ve completely isolated myself from my friends; deactivated my accounts and deleted social media after giving them a short message of how much I appreciate them. 

I don’t know anyone like me, part of me feels like it’s because those like me probably killed themselves from being like this. I don’t blame them. I get why the average life expectancy of bpd is 27, I’m gonna lower it
