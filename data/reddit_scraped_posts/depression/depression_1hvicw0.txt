Today I collapsed to the floor sobbing into my sky and I wanted my body to just give out…I have been in a loveless marriage for the last year and a half. I don’t see an actual out because we have this money pit house, and 2 dogs that I love. I know I will lose the dogs if I leave as I was only able to afford to pay half of the fee for one of them so I have no claim to them. I thought about killing myself…it would be an out and it would make the pain stop. I hate my job despite constantly looking and just like everyone else in the world the struggle for financial stability has been a staple
In my life since I was young… Not sure what I am looking for here. I think I needed to vent or just let it out before I am gone…
