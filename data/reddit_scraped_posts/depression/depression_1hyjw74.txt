Right now I’m on my last $5. This isn’t the first time it’s happened either within the past few months. I work full time and get paid bi weekly, but after bills,expenses,and liabilities I’m usually out of cash for 3-5 days before my payday. Payday loans and paycheck advances are not an option rn

I have a car and half a tank of gas, wondering if there’s any ways I can use that to make money 😭 I’m considering selling my 55” flatscreen tv just so I can have a meal until Tuesday (Sat-Tues)
