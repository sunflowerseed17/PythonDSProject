Hi. I want to do a breast lift surgery, and i was telling my friend about it and she asked me if i had a reference photo. I found it weird, but now i am thinking if it is necessary, or should i just specify what i want (less saggy, smaller areolas etc). I haven't asked a professional because i am still waiting for a deposit maturity so i can afford the surgery.
Also, if there is anyone in europe that has done the procedure, can you please tell me how much did it cost. 
Thanks
