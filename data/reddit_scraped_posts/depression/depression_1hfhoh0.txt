I don't know for what I am here for, I don't know what I am born for

just to provide you with a bit of context

I am a 26 years old born loser who failed at everything, I failed wherever I went, I don't know about what to do in my life

Basically I have no interests in my life and I hate learning & studying about stuff

feel that I am just wasting my Parent's money because of my repeated failures

I often think about ending myself but I don't have the courage to do it, My life is a complete waste, I often feel that I shouldn't have been born
