(TW: Thoughts of suicide is briefly mentioned) 

Hii I’m not sure what flair I should’ve used but for some context I’m 19F & have been diagnosed with depression, GAD & CPTSD. About 3 weeks ago I came back home from college for winter break. I’ve noticed ever since I’ve came home, I’ve been WAY more depressed & irritated. I started having flashbacks to aloooot of traumatic stuff in my childhood/adolescence years & it’s been affecting my self esteem and mood overall. Suicide is also causally on my mind like NOTHING bad will have happened & my mind just goes to thinking about it & I’ll try to fight the thoughts away. I’ve also been having very weird nightmares. They feel super real & they all are different from each other too, but sometimes I do wake up a bit startled or cry but I always wake up unsettled. Also I was 2 weeks late on my period which is VERY odd because I’m rarely late & if I am it’s just by a few days. I’ve been trying to go back to hobbies like crocheting for example, but I just cry while crocheting. I also exercise & go on walks but I still cry or have flashbacks while exercising. I can play games with friends or hang out with them & I’ll feel super anxious & sad & when I’m with family (mainly my dad) I get VERY irritated. Anytime I see him or talk to him I just get irritated even though most of the time he did nothing bad. Should I try to talk to my stepmom about this? I’ve been nervous to because I don’t wanna open up about what’s been happening. I thought my emotions might’ve been because of my period like I had PMS even though I was late but I honestly feel worse now.
