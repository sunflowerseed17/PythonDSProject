Sometimes I feel like I was meant to be born centuries ago so I could just be born, hunt and gather, then die of tuberculosis at age 16 or something. I’m really don’t think I’m meant to grow old anymore. I’m alive because I don’t want my family to hurt, and honestly, I do carry a bit of false hope. I really have nothing going for me and I’m miserable no matter what I do. I take medicine for my depression, I go to weekly therapy, I go to the gym daily, I try to socialize whenever I can, I have a part-time job (been unsuccessful searching for anything related to my degree or really anything that pays better in general since I graduated last May), I try to distract myself with hobbies, etc. But nothing really makes me happy anymore, like, the only thing I genuinely enjoy doing is sitting in my car and just staring at nothing for like an hour after I park when I get home. 

The past few weeks I honestly stopped job searching all together, I stopped brushing my teeth, I haven’t cleaned my room at all, etc. i have absolutely nothing to look forward to, I hate myself, I’m still not over my ex, all my friends either live far away or are busy with full-time jobs, and I just feel so alone. I literally don’t know what else to do. I’m embarrassed just existing and I just wish I never existed in the first place. I feel like a terrible person all the time despite being a huge people pleaser and I just wish I was enough
