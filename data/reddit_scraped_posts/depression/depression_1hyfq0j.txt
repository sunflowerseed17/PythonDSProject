if ur recovering or trying to recover and alcohol or anyone drinking is a trigger for u, dont read this


i drank earlier, i know i am an alcoholic, im 15, i just cant stop, im really drunk right now, i feel like im about to throw up, i went 2 or 3 days without drinking, i dont even know why i did, now everything is spinning and i just dont feel good, it feels like im falling backwards and forwards at the same time, usually i dont drink this much, i only drank slightly more than usual, but now its just giving me anxiety because last time i drank too much and got alcohol poisoning, i know i wont get it this time but it still scares me, i dont even know what im blabbering about and idk why im posting this or where this is going

edit: thank you to everyone who responded, but i dont even remember posting this
