Sometimes i wonder “Do i want to be depressed, is it something im choosing“ then ive realized i have just lived with it for so long and nothing truly helps.

i think back on the times i was truly happy, where nothing was bad and all was well. And how good that felt.

i wish i could go back but i cant. I dont think I’ll be that happy again. And ill probably never feel it.
