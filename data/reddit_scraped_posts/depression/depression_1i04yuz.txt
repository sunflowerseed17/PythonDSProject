i got severely hurt at work a few years ago,  i was adamant i wanted to try to return to work but i am in horrible pain and my mental health has been steadily declining, i always deny SI when asked because i am terrified of what will happen and i say no i wouldn't i have kids or something like that.  Im not doing good, im in workers comp and they just want me to get back to work and im literally hanging on by a thread.  I dont have another year in me to do this and getting stuck in a shitty job all day in pain is going to push me over the edge.  Both my hands are fucked and im so miserable idk how im even going to work a normal job.  i have tried so many medications and did therapy but didnt feel it was benefiting me anymore so it was discontinued.  What else is there to try, im literally struggling to even make it through the day, my kids keep catching me crying, i want to be here for them and feel better but i cant keep doing this.  whats even left to try at this point?  I completely quit drinking, i have changed my diet, incorporated exercise, lost 40 lbs, tried a ton of medications and the only ones that seem to work are the ones that cause complete emotional blunting.  I cant keep doing this and i cant even beleive this is real life most days.  has anybody ever gotten through something like this.  This is not just a fleeting moment of i hate my life, its literally every waking second.  i cant ever get out of my head, i want to get through this im just so hopeless and this entire injury and ins process has consumed whatever mental strength i had left in me.
