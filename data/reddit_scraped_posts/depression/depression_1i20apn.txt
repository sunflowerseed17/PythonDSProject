Lost my dad when i was 13, and my mom when i was 18. I am now 24, moved to a different country, i live alone and i live thousand miles from my siblings and the loneliness gets too much sometimes. I barely have friends here, don’t talk much to my friends back home anymore. I never had a boyfriend nor do i have someone to talk to everyday. I pretty much live for myself. I have a job that pays well, and actually enjoy doing it. I don’t have any problems, it’s just that i feel like my life isn’t meaningful and i do not live for anything else. I could disappear tomorrow and no one else would notice. Most days the loneliness and depression get to me. I try to go out whenever i have off days and go to the gym to maybe cure whatever im feeling yet i still feel empty. I wish i have my parents still cos i feel like they’re the only ones who truly loved me :( so sorry for venting my sadness here. I just don’t have anyone to talk to.
