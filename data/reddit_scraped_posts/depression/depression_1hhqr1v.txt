It all started when my crush played poker with this large group of friends and I'm too scared to ask to join in idk why, it might be because the group is a bit judgemental and they often joke around and I have no idea how to respond and just stay silent. I hate being like this. Now I will never get a chance to socialize with my crush. Please help!
