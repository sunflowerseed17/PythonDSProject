I know with depression, there's things to cope and deal with it naturally. Eat healthy, exercise, etc... 

I have a back injury that flairs up constantly. I've had depression long before I ever had this back pain, but I feel like even tho I exercise (modified for the injury) and eat healthy, the pain will never fully go away for me. And even tho eating healthy and exercising and all those things will still help all that... ill never fully escape the pain, and therefore also the depression.

I want to get a motorcycle. And I feel like maybe my back pain won't allow me to be fully free like I want to be with anything. And it makes me sad.

Anyone else relate? If so is there anything that helos?
