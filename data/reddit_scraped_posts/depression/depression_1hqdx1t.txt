I've noticed that whenever I see someone talk about what they think of the ending and it's negative they get a large amount of backlash, and are told why they have that opinion instead of being able to express it themself. And if they do they're just told they didn't understand the story when it's literally an opinion if you like something or not. I'm new to AOT, I only finished it very recently but the divide in the fandom is pretty clear. I've heard that the divide was worse years ago when the manga ended though. Why is it so contentious?
