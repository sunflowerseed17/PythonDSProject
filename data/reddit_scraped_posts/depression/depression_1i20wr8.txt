For the last two years my life has been a miserable, For context last year I was just doing my work in class when the two trouble makers put a dead moth that they found in in some paper and gave it to a girl, later my desk partner jokingly tried setting me up with this girl that they gave the dead moth and she said she would rather date that dead moth than me. I am 14 turning 15 I’m am the youngest of my class so I turn 15 last I get called the baby of the bunch alot I look a lot younger I get mistaken for being grade 7 a lot Im quite short not genetically gifted my family is poor our house is messy I only have a phone and laptop and my (best friend) from primary school left me for the popular group because they all have money and look good. The only person that cares for me is my sister who saw me crying. all of my grandparents are dead I don’t have aunties or uncles I’m really stupid I got kicked out of all my applied classes and I just can’t catch a break I just want to be alone in my room away from people.
