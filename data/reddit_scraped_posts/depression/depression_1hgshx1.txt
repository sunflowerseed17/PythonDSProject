Requesting Opinions:  

36F (yes, I am androgynous / masculine)

I have a decent jawline and kind of a big chin. I would say my facial bone structure is pretty good overall. I donâ€™t have trouble breathing or allergies. I am also a stocky person that can easily hold some extra weight without having a fatty neck. However, I recently found out I have apnea- obstructive, hypopnea, and central. I do have a smaller nose with small nostrils. My events were almost exclusively during REM, which is apparently much more common in women. I also had a previous sleep study which showed alpha wave intrusion, also known as alpha-delta sleep. Any thoughts on this? I currently use an APAP with full face mask, although I still rip it off while sleeping.
