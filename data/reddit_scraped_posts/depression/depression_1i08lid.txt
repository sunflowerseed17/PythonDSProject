As the title says, I have extreme anxiety about studying and exams- I have a hard time with the prospects of failing a subject. It mostly comes down to the fact I’m in pharmacy school and there’s a heavy work load + expectations that have left me fragile mentally. I’ve been trying to study for my finals but whenever I open up anything I get a paralyzing anxiety once I don’t understand a concept. My exam is on Thursday and I’m afraid to fail- I already think I failed another :(. My doctor tried giving me propranolol and it did nothing to ease my anxiety. I don’t know how to calm myself because I really need to get it together and study
