What are some lash serums that genuinely work? I’ve used one lash serum in the past (Luxros Advanced Eyelash Enhancing Serum) and it did nothing for me. I’ve been insecure about my sparse lashes for as long as i can remember and I’d love for them to be naturally long. Ik castor oil is used for hair growth and I’m using that on my hair rn, but I’m not sure if it’s safe to use on the eyes. Thank you
