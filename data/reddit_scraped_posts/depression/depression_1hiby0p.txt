I used to do some pretty cool things in my twenties. Now, I just don't want to do anything, or care. Just wanna go to work, come home, make a ton of money but spend very little of it. Get and rv, and just go. I don't want to care about my family anymore. Everything just hurts and I have no money for therapy. If I had money it'd be going to my medical needs anyway. Back injury, infections. Teeth rotting out and those freaking huuuuurt.

Just wasting away right now.
