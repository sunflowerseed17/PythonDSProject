Hi guys,

I suffer from depression already 15 years as a result of childhood trauma. I tried different approaches but many things did not help me ( antidepressants etc)! I would like to know what is your biggest struggle ( beyond of thousands physical and emotional problems)Mine is struggling with energy. I either sleep too much and then I do’t have energy or I sleep very bad and then I had a “Hangover” feeling all day….
I have been thinking to follow finally CBT and wake up and go to bed every day at the same time and maybe my struggle with energy will fade away…
Opinions?
I am still taking low dose of medication but my thing is how to live with depression, how to deal with that? What did help you?
