So, I know SQL from doing practice questions and using them at work a bit. 

I am very familiar with window functions and what not. 

But I still think learning the theory is very important. 

If I take the database design class, will I feel a significant "leap" in my SQL knowledge? 

Especially from two perspectives - theory and practical view points separately evaluated.

I am debating if I should take the class or not.
