Holy shit my fuckin past posts are insane dude. I was 15. I was an incel virgin and I’m a girl how is that possible. I am pathetic. Thinking of unaliving soon tbh. 

Since then I’ve done a lot of drugs. And my brain is turning to mush. But I’ve learned that life is short. It’s not cool to call people faggot, dyke or any other slur. Sex, gender and sexuality; we fall within their spectrums, not their binaries. Yeah im losing my fucking mind but at least I have nothing to lose except my friends and family who I love. I’ll die in debt but oh well I’m not going to have kids. I’ll do my best. Hopefully I’ll make it to 21. Then I’m going to do it. Unless I’ve gotten better by then. Gotta quit my shitty job. We will see
