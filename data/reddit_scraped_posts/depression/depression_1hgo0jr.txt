It's a fantasy of mine to go bikepacking. I'm a triathlete with three bikes, none of which are probably appropriate for bikepacking (my old aluminium race bike, a carbon race bike that lives on a trainer all winter and is trained on all summer, and a heavy as all get go trek dualsport mountain/gravel bike which I commute around  the city with). What should I be looking for in a backpacking bike? How do I get started? Do I do an organized bikepacking trip with a company? I've always been a solo traveler. I need someone or a book or a website to point me in the right direction and maybe see if bikepacking is my new jam.  If bikepacking doesn't work out, I might have to discover pickleball as a hobby :/
