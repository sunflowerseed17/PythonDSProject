for some background: last mothers day, my ex threatened for us to break up for the millionth time because I "disobeyed his orders" when i decided to sleep over at my moms for the night. So i agreed, we broke up. I felt free, I felt scared but I felt free. we were together for 7 years, and his reasoning for all the abuse was he wanted to sleep with other women but i "wouldnt let him".......

anyway - 

fast forward to tonight, i get a weird text saying "hey \[my name\], i know you have loads of folders of nudes, why not give me a few? youre so pathetic and just dying for attention, i want to give you that attention."

so i say, "you have the wrong number" and i thought that would be the end of it. 

nope. *sigh.*

i ask my ex straight up if its him, he starts texting with proper grammar so i know its him (lol)  
so ..instead of feeding in to the BS, instead of agreeing with him the insults he said, I insulted him back. 

**I finally insulted him back. and it felt FUCKING GOOD.** 

why do people do this? we have been separated for almost a year already. Im sorry if hes not having any luck dating wise, he was so so happy to say how quick he was to get back out there and "finally be free" from me. now its like he cant stop trying to contact me lately. I am still unsure of who i am as a person, and it feels weird going out later than 4pm, to even think of having friends, still. But if theres one thing i have learned in the last 365 days: i deserve to love myself. i deserve that freedom. i deserve the friends. i dont care about him anymore. i wish he would leave me be.
