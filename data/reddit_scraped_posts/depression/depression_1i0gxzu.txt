I need to vent and get some perspective.

I (38M) have been married for 4 years to my wife (39F), but we’ve been together a total of 6 years. Everything was great before we tied the knot – frequent sex and a close relationship. But after marriage, intimacy took a nosedive. We went about 4 years without sex, had it once, and then back to square one.

I’ve tried talking to her about our lack of intimacy, but the excuses just keep piling up. 

Here’s some context: I have a son from a previous relationship and had a vasectomy at 25 after my first marriage ended in divorce. My wife was in an unhappy marriage for 10 years and cheated during the last couple of years of that relationship.

On top of this, her mother moved in with us 4 years ago, and her sister joined us on our land 3 years ago (she’s now pregnant with her fourth child). 

I know my wife isn’t cheating – I’ve got cameras and Life 360 for peace of mind. Still, her lack of sexual interest is puzzling. The typical excuses are, "I'm not in the mood," "I'm on my period," or "I'm too tired." When we recently discussed it, I asked if she thought my vasectomy affected her desire. She seemed to imply that it might.

I’m at my wit's end. Should I change my approach and not be as loving? I hate having the same conversation with her every month. Is outsourcing a solution? Any advice or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated!
