me (22m) and my gf (24f) have been dating almost 4 years and live together. when we first started dating i lived in a few states away and only saw her once a week if that. when we’d be apart we’d text a lot about sex and the anticipation would build and be very easy to act on right when we got together in person. we’ve lived together for almost 2 years and it has shown a few things:
-she would prefer to have sex everyday (fine with me but how do i not be repetitive if it’s everyday)
-we both initiate sex but probably her more than me (id like to do it more and be more dominant/confident in general)
-i initiate the same way which is usually like a massage or something or just kinda start kissing her 
-with our work schedules we have time after 7pm and weekends really whenever. 

i don’t know what to say/do to initiate even though she has said she isn’t gonna say no and will tell me if she ever didn’t want to. i still feel scared of rejection and feel like that’s a turn off for someone who likes dominance in the bedroom. i want to be more confident and expressive to start. once we get going everything is great it’s just starting without being timid or awkward.
