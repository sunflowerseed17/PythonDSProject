Does anyone else sleep as much as they can to avoid being conscious? It’s all I’m able to do at the moment when my depression is this bad. I’m in so much mental pain that I cry and scream whenever I’m awake. I can’t shower or brush my teeth or get dressed, so I’m not able to leave my room. I barely eat or drink and even going to the toilet is a massive struggle now. 

I’m currently in therapy (online) which I’ve been in and out of for years now, (been depressed since I was a teenager, I’m 32 now) and I’ve tried virtually every antidepressant that exists over the years. Nothing is helping. 

Is there anyone else in a similar situation that has any advice? I can’t go on like this. I feel like I’ve tried everything but nothing is working. I’m just numb.
