So, I’m trying to plan my trip and want to know at what time I need to buy train tickets. However, I might be wrong, I think I’ve heard of something like you have to come earlier in the day, check-in and do something like numbering. Then you can go away and come back later in the day when they start letting people in. But maybe I’m just stupid, might be completely wrong though, It’s my first time going to a concert. 
And if it is indeed true, does anyone know if that’s the case for Taemin in Paris as well?
Do I need to come early and if at what time or can I just come a few hours before?
I’ll highly appreciate some help. 🙏
