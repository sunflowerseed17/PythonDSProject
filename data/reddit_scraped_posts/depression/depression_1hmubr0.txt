I had to reinstall steam. Now even after adding my library folder to steam the installed games show as installed in steam. I installed fallout 4 to where it is on my drive. It verifies the files and proceeds to redownload all 90gb of game files. I check the folder on my PC fallout 4 is now 400mb.

Can someone explain what's going on  and how to fix it please
