I drove that sweet boy away two years ago but we were still off and on he shot himself last year and I was stalking his repost they were sad I was talking to him we were both sad but I should have noticed and helped him I never knew I’d lose him like that so soon I’m just so guilty feeling I’ve been struggling with suicidal thoughts majority of my life and it’s just so much worse I can barley survive I don’t wanna survive anymore
