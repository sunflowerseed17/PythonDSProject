No matter how easy or small, I screw it up and hate myself a little more each time. I don’t understand people. I always feel like everyone dislikes me, makes fun of me behind my back, and thinks I’m an idiot so l keep to myself. I’m now 33 and the loneliness has gotten exponentially worse. And yet I continue to isolate myself. I am convinced I will end up killing myself at some point. I wouldn’t be surprised if it was within the next year. The only reason that I haven’t yet is I know it would ruin my Mom’s life. I wouldn’t be surprised though if my brain convinced me that I will ruin her life either way by making her worry about me the rest of her life if I don’t do it so overall it might cause less pain to do it now.
