I received a random message request on Reddit from someone in my country. I didn’t know them, but the message said, "Sis, please gatekeep subs." I understood the point about keeping things low-key, so I responded with, "It’s a small community only."
The person then replied, "It’s 110k people, and you think that’s small?"

For context, I’ve never talked about subs either in real life or online. However, being told outright that I shouldn’t post about subs at all—and that I should use a different account if I want to post—felt a bit rude. I mean, who are they to tell me what I can or can’t do, right?
