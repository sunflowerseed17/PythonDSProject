My family has put me through a lot. They have stalked me, physically abused me, locked me in/out of the house, everything. My mom is a pervert, severely mentally ill and just horrible to be around. She supports my brother, who has also attacked me, to study abroad, but can't be fucked to help me so that I can stop being homeless. She enjoys exerting power and control over me specifically for some reason. She has been getting me Airbnb's that last for a couple of nights before picking me up and taking me somewhere new, and this isn't sustainable long-term because I have a job. Now, she is saying she can't help at all, even though she said she would at first. I realized all she really wanted was to know where I was because I cut contact with my whole family for over a year, since before the last time I left, they weren't even letting me eat food in the house and we're hiding soap and toilet paper from me. So, I've been duped. I'm still homeless and now my mother has control over me again and my abusive family knows where I live and where I work.

I get paid soon and am considering booking a one way trip to a well known bridge. What do you guys think I should do? I've tried and tried to establish myself away from these people, living in shelters and halfway houses and nothing is working. I can't survive on a minimum wage income and I also have racism and misogyny going for me every day. I'm tired and don't want to deal with the world anymore.
