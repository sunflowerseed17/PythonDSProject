Hii I’m 19 and I’m 3 weeks late for my period. If anything I usually have two period a month occasionally but I’ve never been more than a week late. I’m having all my symptoms such as irritability, depression (I’ve been crying almost everyday), constantly hungry, very tired, and I’ve been craving a lot of sweets. I’ve been also having random stomach cramps everyday. Does this happen every once or awhile or is this abnormal?
