Hi.i just wanna know if im in the wrong. today i was practicing my flute for the upcoming concert and my older sister got annoyed said she was drawing for her college applications and told me to go to the basement to play,just so you know all my other familly members are fine with it and its about 5 pm.well anyways i told her no because if she was the one with a problem with it than she should be the one staying in the basement.Well my mom asked me to compromise and i told her i was gonna practice just for 15 more minuites and then my sister opens the basment door and starts yelling insults and i think my mom thinks im right,but i dont know.this has been a rather recurring issue i need another opinion so AITA
