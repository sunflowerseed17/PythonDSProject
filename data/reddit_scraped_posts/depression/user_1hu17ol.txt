The only dream i can recall/remember was a dream i had as a kid. I was probably around 7-9 years old. I wake up at night and i see dark red light shining into my room from outside (I was sleeping at that time in living room idk why did i sleep there probably because i was watching cartoons on vcr probably the Batman  Beyond Joker Returns.) Soo i wake up and i see dark red light from the window coming from ouside. I have no idea what it is. Everything was silent i couldnt hear my dog barking because he had a house near the window. Soo i go to check out the situation from the window i lift up the curtain, and i see the red light coming from a hole in the garden. And then a creature comes out It. It had dark long hair   Body slender and white,   it emited a dark red type like glow. It Started to come to my window and look straight into my eyes like it was calling for me. And thats when i woke up. After that i dont remember a single dream  for 20 years i cant recall a single dream i had. Its like i dont even dream. Every morning when i wake up and try to recall the dream, its literally impossible  its like im cursed or something
