I’m a sophomore in highscool who recently moved to a new school because of rude racists at my old school. i moved because i needed a better environment and a quieter space to work on build into my dream self. I was actually quite social at my old school and happier than i was now. Recently though..i would say around 4 months ago my outgoing behavior recently dropped caused from a chain of realizing i don’t have to perform for anybody and just becoming plain out annoyed when people try to make meaningless convo with me. Something had also happened at work that pushed me to stop “performing “ for people because it’s useless which validated that part of brain who was constantly getting judged no matter how outgoing and friendly i tried to be. A lot of other things i don’t feel like going in depth in happened as well and now i can’t help but think if it is my own doing that drove me into the cycle of depression and the need of wanting to be alone. at first this period of isolation was just to work on myself but i’ve fallen too comfortable with this and now even tend to push new opportunities of friendships etc away. I also listen to a lot of negative ish music which further uplifts my sadness and brings me some kind of validation for my outward behaviors. How do i get out of this mess?  It’s just so comfortable but i know it’s ruining me.
