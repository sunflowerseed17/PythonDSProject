I've talked to two people I know in the same situation as me (ADHD and not medicated), and they say they're doing just fine and it's not an excuse I'm doing poorly. I don't understand how I can be invalidated if they "supposedly" understand. I tried explaining but they won't budge. It just makes me sad and angry
