So I have adhd but I also have severe major depressive disorder without psychotic episodes. Since I take concerta I canâ€™t take Prozac, so I was thinking of going with Wellbutrin, as it is concerta friendly. I was hoping to get some input on how well Wellbutrin works and if there are any better options. Any input is greatly appreciated!
