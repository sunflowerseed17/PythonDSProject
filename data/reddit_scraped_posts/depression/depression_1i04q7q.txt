Well, I'm 37f waiting for my divorce to go through...I'm slowly getting my confidence back. I over stayed in a unhealthy marriage to a man child who I paid all of the bills for when he made 4x as much as I did. Yeah, he's fucked, surprisingly, I got more money in the 1st month of alimony then what he ever invested in me and the kids. 

I had to relearn to be social because my ex had me so poor I couldn't do anything outside of my home. It's been interesting to be outside and managing my own spare money...I have a savings account now for emergencies and I can buy new shoes if I like, I can buy my kids things and after struggling with depression for 2 years (during this process) I think I'm climbing out of this funk. That's all, I just wanted to share. 

Oh! It's amazing to not be called names in front of my family too.
