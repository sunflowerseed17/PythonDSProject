I can’t even explain the extent of self sabotage I impose upon myself. I almost feel like I’m possessed. I try not to acknowledge it because it’s truly terrifying when I stop even for a second and consider the fact that I’m working against myself and I’m clocking in over time doing it. I’m always one step ahead of myself. Always able to figure how to foil any positive progression or momentum I have going for myself. Iont think I’m doing the severity of my dilemma justice with these measly words. IM COOKED. I love you tho.
