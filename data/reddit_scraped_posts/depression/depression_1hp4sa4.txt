I’m struggling to accept that I’m gunna feel things way the rest of my life. It’s a self defeating thing that I do to myself. I actually don’t mind being alone, it’s where I feel most comfortable but I don’t want to be lonely. I push everyone away that comes close anyways. I don’t know where I missed the mark but I sincerely believe I’m gunna die alone and it’s been scaring me. I have friends and family but I cannot shake the feeling of loneliness. I cannot connect with anyone anymore and I feel alienated and like some ugly creature. I would do anything at this point to have a partner like everyone else. I want to be loved and I want to love. I don’t even know what that would feelike anymore. 

It’s about noon, and I’m gunna go get a bottle and some beer. I think it’s the only thing keeping me alive at this point
