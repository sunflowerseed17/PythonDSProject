So I'm pretty new and don't understand the navy. I was playing monarchist non historical Germany and tried to naval invade and couldn't gain anywhere near 50% superiority, they have so many more ships than I do and I tried to send my submarines out so that they might divert their attention but that didn't help much and I think they destroyed all my submarines. What do I do?

Btw I haven't invaded the Benelux or France yet because they allied with like all the Balkans and Italy.
