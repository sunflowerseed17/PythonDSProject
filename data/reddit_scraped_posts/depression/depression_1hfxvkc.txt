Like, I want to tell specific family members some hurtful things. Just to make them go away.

Then I'll have periods where I feel bad and want to talk to them. I'm 37f. Wtf. I havent acted on it.

Im mad at my family. I really just hate my life and want everyone to go away. Except my kids.

My mom just pisses me tf off. All the time with her manipulation. My dad is just, a manipulative jerk. Like the only person I feel bad for hurting is my grandma and everyone in my family is weaponizing this to get me to come around. Like why, so when people piss me off they can talk bad about me behind my back? I just do not like any of my cousins. At all. My only sibling is dead. And I absolutely hate my sister in law. There's just so much there. I just want to cut them all off.
