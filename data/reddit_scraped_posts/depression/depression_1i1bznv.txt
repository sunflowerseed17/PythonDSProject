For the last 2 years I've been taking medication for my depression which has seriously helped. While I still experience occasional episodes, I've never felt better in life.

Unfortunately, a few days ago I had a very severe episode where my gf of a year stepped into the bathroom and saw me laying down mumbling to myself about suicide. We had a talk about her being traumatized seeing me in a state like this, and discussed seeing a therapist as well as cutting back on alcohol since I'd been drinking during the night. It was a painful discussion, but seemed to work well and I felt better about the state of things, we agreed to meet on Thursday to talk more.

Yesterday she told me she's taking a break from her phone for a few days since she's having a very hard time. She's also been dealing with work, her grandmother in a poor state of health, and lives with diabetes. I've never felt anxious in our relationship until this point and I'm terrified it's all going to end because of me. I wish I didn't suffer from this awful condition but I never asked for it, I thought I was doing better but evidently not enough.

TL;DR I'm scared one of the few things in life I loved will be destroyed because of my depression.
