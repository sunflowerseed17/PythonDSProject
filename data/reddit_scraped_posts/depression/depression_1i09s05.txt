Title: Really I want to get out my house and live on my own soon, but since I’m a sophomore, I have to live with my sister and her bf for 2 more years, and that’s pretty long.

Hello, those who are reading this came from a catholic dude whos been struggling with family problems and adhd shit. I’ve been struggling with adhd since I was 4th or 7th grade, rn I’m a sophomore. Ever since high school, specifically mid-9th grade, I’ve started to get hated from my sister and her bf due to how I lack common sense. They never apologize, or even ask if I’m okay. Whenever my dad talks about my sister being mean and rude, he said “She still loves you and she gives you food a lot, don’t take it personally.” I understand she still loves me and allat, but it just hurts me to the fact I just want to walk and go outside to go to nall and shit so she wouldn’t have to annoy tf out of me. Yes I’ve sinned because rn I talked shit about my sister, it’s just me venting because I can’t control her personality and who she is. I’m not saying I hate her, I still do love her, but some days she would break my heart and disappoint me by her words. Such words as, “BITCH, GO LOOK WITH YOUR EYES, I AINT GONNA WASTE MY TIME ANSWERING YOUR FUCKINNG QUESTION.” I understand all that stress from you comes from family problems, and colleges and shit, but i don’t understand letting all the anger out to me. I didn’t intentionally make you mad, I didn’t expect you to be very angry, I wanted to ask kindly so you could respond with a better response. Look I know everyone is going to say “L Vicre, just let sis be sis”, she is nice to everyone, but she’s acting like a 5 year old ipad kid to me. I feel lost and just wanna get out the house so I can feel free being in my own time. More onto her bf, im going to rage here. I’m really disappointed to the fact he changed from my “therapist” to a bitch who acts like he’s tough enough to punch my fucking face. My sis and him allows each other to verbally bitch slap my ass just cuz I exist. If anything, the fact my parents aren’t doing any shit just to get this situation situated just doesn’t make sense. Why am wasting my time waiting for the right time to leave the house, while you guys don’t give advice. I have been heartbroken several times cuz yall mfs don’t do shit, I swear, I was about to 👊 her bf because he’s laughing like he don’t gaf about me anymore, not even my mental health. And you know what, act like a fucking adult and not talk shit in front of my face. Sorry if I say anything bad about my sis and him, it’s just to let it all out here so I feel comfortable. I think my sis and him is talking shit about me while i have my headphones on while listening to “xxxtentacion” rn. I will be crying sometimes at night, and I would think things will get better or worse. I think I’ve sinned too much here since I ranted all the stuff I wanted to say, but thank you for listening to my thoughts and depression. I don’t want to get a mental breakdown again like few months ago because I was about to cause a scene in my living room.  Peace be with you everyone who is reading ✝️✌️
