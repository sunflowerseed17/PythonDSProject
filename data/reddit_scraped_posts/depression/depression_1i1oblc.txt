my mom has a camera in the living room which i usually turn around so it cant see me when im out there. i know im a bad kid, i take her alcohol and vape, but she already knows that. apparently theres been a completely different camera out there this whole time too, and shes been seeing EVERYTHING. i wouldnt be worried except i cry out there, i think ive even walked out there with no pants on too, and i have a whole lot of scars on my legs that she doesnt know about, plus me and my friend have VERY private conversations out there, i am so embarrassed i just wanna cry, she said she saw me taking her alcohol on the camera and her and my sister were laughing at me, so she definitely does check it, i just dont know what to do, im genuinely terrified of what she may have seen or heard or anything.
