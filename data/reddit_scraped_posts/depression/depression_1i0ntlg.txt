I am 37 and I feel like I missed out on making friends, relationships, and other opportunities to experience life. I feel like Iam behind everyone else. I have nothing look forward to at all. I have a life with no meaning. The only time when life isn't painful to me is when I am asleep I wish sometimes that I would never wake up again.
