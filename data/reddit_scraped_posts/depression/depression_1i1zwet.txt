I’ve always struggled with depression and it’s always been hard. Last month my sister passed away, and it’s been horrible. She was like my mother and we were really close. I have no real friends, I’ve tried reaching out to people to talk but no one comes. I know people have their own lives, I just always assumed when someone says they are your friend that they would make a little bit of time for you. I really am only here because of my son, and because I don’t want to add more stress and pain to my family. But I’m so fucking lonely and I have no one. I’m trying to compartmentalize everything and take it little by little but I am so so sad and alone. I don’t know how to help myself anymore.
