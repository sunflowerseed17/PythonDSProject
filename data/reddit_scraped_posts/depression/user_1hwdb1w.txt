hello ok so i bought a new ssd recently, i gave it to my cousin to install it for me and when he gave it back everything was gone. thereâ€™s only one slot in the motherboard so itâ€™s just one ssd card. i wanted extra storage and everythingâ€™s gone itâ€™s like a completely new windows. was this supposed to happen? was i supposed to back everything up. iâ€™m very upset if i lost everythingðŸ’” he said if i needed everything on the new ssd iâ€™d have to back up everything on the old ssd and put it on the new one. how does this work..
