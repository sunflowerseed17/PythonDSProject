Sex addiction ruined my life, lost my marriage,family, home. Previous relationship previous home went as well, I didn't learn, now it's too late, feeling suicidal, I'm no longer young enough to start again. I want what I can no longer have, my family. I'm the sex addict, unfaithfull, liar, I only wanted to be happy.
I can't get my family back, they know my double life
God help me I feel so very ill
