I have been dealing with Depression all my life. I'm almost 50. I'm always crying and worrying about something. My husband has been diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer and I worry even more now. I also have a 13 year old daughter. A lot of times I neglect doing things for myself so I can take care of them. I am always tired and have no energy. I try hard not to let them see me cry. How do you deal with depression when you just want to stay in bed all day, not shower or brush your teeth? This depression is really getting worse.
