Hi all, entering a stage in my life where I need some advice. I apologize if this isn’t appropriate for this sub. A bit of background - I’m 29f, very happily married and have a successful career with a doctorate. I’ve also been dealing with depression and anxiety, most notably the last 5 years. I have found success with daily Prozac and Wellbutrin, but I also use cannabis daily as a supplement to manage stress and anxiety.  I don’t drink alcohol, and cannabis gives me a safe escape that still allows me to be productive. My husband and I are getting ready to start a family, and of course I will not be touching cannabis once we start trying for a kid. As excited and sure as I am of this next step, I’m most nervous about how putting cannabis aside will affect me throughout pregnancy. I’m so worried my anxiety will explode especially with the hormone fluctuations and I won’t have a crutch to lean on. Please, if any women have been through this, I would appreciate any and all advice! Thank you so much in advance.
