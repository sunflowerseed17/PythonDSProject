i can’t even function anymore without feeling like a failure. i feel like every relationship i get in with somebody it never works out. every time i try something i fail. and every time i try to talk to somebody about my problems they just tell me it’s life. i don’t have any friends expect one and my parents would never understand how or what im feeling. i’ve been really depressed before and it feels like this time it’s way worse nothing i can do anymore is right and i don’t feel like i belong here anymore. i’m on medication but it doesn’t seem like it’s helping, nobody understands, i hate myself and can’t stand to look in the mirror and hate waking up in the morning and seeing i’m still here. life sucks, im not sure how to move on other than ending it at this point.
