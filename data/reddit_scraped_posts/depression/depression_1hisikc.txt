26M, had a woman I really liked recently just friendzone me after a few really great dates and it was the straw that broke the camel’s back. Tried to do some research but I didn’t want some bullshit AI assessment that Google gives you now so I came here 

Basically this was sort of the finale of the past year of dating that is making me take some self inventory and do some introspection. Essentially, it’s just what the title says. I always get friendzoned even after ostensibly good dates. I mean to a comical, laughable, “you gotta be kidding me” degree. It is truly incessant. Not one woman hasn’t done this in the last year. Hell even the few women I’ve had sex with in the past year turn right around and friendzone me immediately after. 

Just trying to ascertain why nobody seems to be interested in me romantically. I don’t think I’m super ugly? Least I hope not. To even have some beautiful women carve out a few hours from their precious schedules to see me for a date or two tells me I have to have some sort of minimum threshold of attractiveness. But it’s always no matter how much I made her laugh, no matter how much we have in common, no matter how much she compliments me on how smart or kind or whatever I am. It always seems like it’s leading somewhere romantic then bam. 

And it’s always the same kinda rhetoric. These women turn into the HR ladies. Always “you’re so genuinely nice and sweet but-“ “I think you’re a really really great guy but-“ every single time almost. A year ago I was getting friendzoned by a beautiful atheist woman after a great first few dates and a year later that literal exact same thing has happened so now I’m just wondering how to improve or at least figure out what I’m doing wrong
