Screw analyzing everything. Screw trying to find meaning. I wish I was stupid and simple and maybe my default emotion wouldn’t be sadness and despair. I wish something as simple as reading a book or going outside made me feel better. I wish I was simple and stupid so I wouldn’t know when people hurt me. I’m so tired I wish I could end it
