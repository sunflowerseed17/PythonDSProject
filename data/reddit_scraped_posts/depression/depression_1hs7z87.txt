Happy new year to you all wonderful peeps out there. My birthday is on 11th of this month and I’m turning 40. How can I make my birthday more exciting with my friends? I have around 20 friends to hang out with, but I’m kinda bored doing the same old stuff like eating and then hitting the pubs. I was wondering do you have any ideas to celebrate here in Vancouver ? 

PS :- I am almost broke from buying gifts last month, so running on a budget atm
