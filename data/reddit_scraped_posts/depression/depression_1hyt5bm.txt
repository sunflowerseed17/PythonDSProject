My mom basically sacrificed her entire life for me and I wish she hadn't. Now I have to live up to her expectations. I have to be successful in school, life, and everything because that's what she wants. She has done so much for me and I just want her to be happy. And she is happy when I do good in life. That's when she's the happiest. But I am so tired. I just want to lie down, I want to disappear. I don't want to do anything. I can't do that. How can I take away my mom's only hope? If she was just less nice, if she loved me less, I wouldn't have to make her happy.
