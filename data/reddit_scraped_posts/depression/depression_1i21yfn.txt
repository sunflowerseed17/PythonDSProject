Recently, I feel very nostalgic; this makes me feel depressed. I used to have a few friends to chill with during Sundays, and many people appreciate me because of my talent. I was also very diligent in striving for my academy. But now I have become avoidant of everything and have no friends. I miss the time when I could enjoy living in the moment. I don't even know how I came to this step where I became so isolated at school and just bed-rotting all day during the holidays. literally only two years past. Everything feels so surreal; I can't believe those memories. I mean, I know sometimes we feel nostalgic because we romanticised those moments, but life now seems to be nothing good.
