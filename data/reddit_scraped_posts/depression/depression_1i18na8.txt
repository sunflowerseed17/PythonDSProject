My parents are good and try to give me everything, and I study hard for them to make them happy and i will always get A+ on my exams (my parents don't care about my grades unless i don't study). The problem is that I had a depression episode and thought about suicide, and I am still struggling with eating disorder. So, I didn't study that much and I did really bad in the exams. My parents were sad and tell me I didn't study which is true but they don't know the reason, i asked my mother if she is disappointed in me she tells me no but i feel it's true. I always tell myself it is fine as long as I know that I struggled in this period of my life so my grade doesn't matter and any person in there life suffer at least once in there life. But I think that my friends will move away from me as I have got bad grades and I think that I am such a failure. And I have dreams that makes me hate myself more. I am just scared that I will have a depression episode again.

(My parents don't know about my mental health cause I just don't want them to tell me that I am just pretending and tell me that I don't know what a real mental health)
