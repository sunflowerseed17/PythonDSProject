So I literally searched Youtube, Google and fuck even Microsoft community for damn near a day now and nothing worked, so I'm asking ya'll to help me out on this.

Things I've done:

Reinstall/ Checked sound mixer if it's muted/  Turned off mute audio on focus loss/  Updated drivers/ Verified the integrity/ Updated DirectX/ I messed with the output but nothing/ Tried without any apps running in the background
