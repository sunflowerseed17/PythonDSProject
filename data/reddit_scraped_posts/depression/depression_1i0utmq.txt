I feel it growing wider, deeper. Its expansion knows no end.

There is a pit there, in the crux of my being. It hungers fervently. It gnaws effortlessly.

The pit that takes all that I know and love time and time again, only to spit out a vile and perverted version of what it really is.

Everything begins to slip through my fingers.

I fear the pit will claim it, so what would be the point of holding onto it? Only tragedy knows its way past the pit. It slithers by it, inserting itself into my soul. I hold on to that feeling, for it is all I know. But at least it is something, oh god - it is SOMETHING.

Tragedy oh tragedy, let it be something else that finds its way into my being just this once, I plead time and time again.

Then, as I find myself before the mirror once more, it answers;

"No. This is all you are, you see? Think back on every last day. Every last thing you've done and experienced... It was you, was it not? It was never I who denied you joy. It was never I who denied you wonder. It was never I who denied you everything you have ever craved. It was you. You craved me above all. You chose me. Now, this is what you are - you are me and I am you."

I know this. Deep down I know this. I chose this path long ago, at an age I was still a fool. I refused to see joy. I refused to experience wonder.

Now, this is my fate. A maddening series of meltdowns that will repeat until eventually silence finds me.

Oh how I crave that silence. Oh how I crave it.

But even that, I secretly reject.



...What can I still accept, besides the hole? Besides tragedy?
