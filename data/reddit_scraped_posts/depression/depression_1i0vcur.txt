Just a bit of a rant, wanted somewhere to throw up my thoughts. Hoping to reach anyone going through something similar. I’m 27(M). I have a job and live with my parents I’m currently also going to school. I have struggled with depression forever and I am very suicidal. My grip is currently the financial struggle I’ve been placed in, since working part time. I can’t ever seem to make ends meet and there are times I go days without eating. I try not to complain because I don’t pay much rent. I’m currently looking for a higher paying job and I’m trying to freelance in video editing, but everyday the debt I have grows bigger and just makes me sadder and angrier and anxious and just wanting to give up and end it all. I remain hopeful because I feel like I’m on the right path. I encourage anyone who is in a similar situation to keep up hope. It has to get better right?
