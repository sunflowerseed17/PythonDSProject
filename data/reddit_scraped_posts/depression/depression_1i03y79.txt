So for a bit of context I'm not exactly a small man I'm almost 6" and wide as hell but I seem to be not noticed to a dtrang degree I can evedrop by just standing nearby I scare people when I just appear in the group (like in person) I only ever seen to be noticed when I talk I seem to be forgotten all the time I was extremely active in a friend group I know in real life went dark for a bit. And by that I mean I stopped talking in the gc. For. A. Month. And no one noticed. But as I said none of this bothers me. I am just kind of content being a "spectator" if you will. "Is this a sign I'm "special" or smthin?
