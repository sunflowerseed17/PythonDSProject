Not that I’m going to, but I’m kind of curious how she’d react. Been going to her for a year and was recently diagnosed with autism and social anxiety. However I’ve never told my therapist about my self destruction thoughts that I’ve had since I was 13 years old. 

I just don’t want my life to get even worse through being forced to be in a facility or recommended pills. I’ve already been recommended pills for my social anxiety. I do really want my life to end though, I have made plans and have one now.
