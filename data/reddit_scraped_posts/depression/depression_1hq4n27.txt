Being introverted in a small town is hell. Im 18 and never had a gf. I had 1 talking stage but that lasted about 3 months.Anyone in my town has a 50% chance at being your cousin but not many people here interest me. I've seen some beautiful women that dress or even look cool.Natural you'd want to talk to them,not me.The problem is these girls were at Dollar General,Walmart,McDonald's. How do you respond when someone says where'd you meet and you say "Walmart".On top of being introverted,I wouldn't call myself handsome. Im pretty big and my interests are 'Boring or Weird" according to my friends.I feel somewhat confident talking to them but its the time and place that scares me away. Im just here to look for some advice.
