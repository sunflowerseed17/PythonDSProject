I don't mean about being younger but I do kinda mean that.Im Gen Z(2005) and I'm from a very small town(<500 people).As I've gotten older and started buying my own things I started to realize if times were better back then.My grandparents always tell the back in my day stories and it was so much better.This would be the 60s 70s and no one cared.Kids were stupid and often had to teach themselves.You parents taught you just as much or more than your teacher.Even my parents,80s and 90s,even the 2000s were so much better.I really got feeling sad when I was out wandering around town.Nothing,no one cares about the town(Towns only a 20 minute walk from border to border),and the one factory is abandoned.I was at this factory at like 9pm thinking how there's suppose to be 2nd shift workers here.Even myself,I work in a factory out of town,felt like I would be here if it weren't closed.All the business on main street closed when I was a kid.This was a thriving town,maybe even a small city,when my grandparents and my parents were kids.Im not sure what this would be called but it really had me thinking and how much I hate this time.Cars,houses,jobs,the people,were just so much better.Has anyone else felt this way?I apologize if this topic don't make sense,I just could find nothing on it
