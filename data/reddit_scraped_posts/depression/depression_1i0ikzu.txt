I'm from India in my late 20s, was a good kid completed engineering but realized that I would hate working in that field so I went on to do my MBA in marketing post the pandemic. Graduated couple of years back had a good resume - projects, research papers, internships etc. Due to the job market it almost took me 10 months after graduation to land on a job, not to brag but I gave it my 100% and worked super hard for few months but was laid off due to mass layoffs. I have been searching for a job for the past one year with no success. Personally the situation at home is not so good, lost my mother suddenly 4 months back, dad is old with no savings and is going to be dependent on me. I don't have a laptop to do any freelance work and relatives are of no help, friends are just starting out in life adulting so helping me is difficult for them. I also have an education loan which I am unable to pay and have been getting calls constantly. I just got rejected from the job which I thought was going to be the one. Have done everything, networking, applying in many job sites for at least 50+ applications per day, updated my profile regularly, taking online certication. At this point I'm completely broken, depressed and feel like I'm a waste of space and have nothing to look forward too in life. Please any advice or feedback would be appreciated. It's not a rage bait or I'm not lying, please I'm desperate
