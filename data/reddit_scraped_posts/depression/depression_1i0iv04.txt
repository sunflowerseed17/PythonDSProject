I don’t know if I want to kill myself but I wish there were another option . Just end my existence and everyone’s memories of me completely wiped. I’m desperate at this point for something to happen in my life. I have nothing but dark thoughts and I wonder what life was like when I wasn’t this way. Maybe I always was. I was homeless when I was 19 20 and that’s the last time I honestly felt happy and free. I think that’s what’s gunna end up of me. I want to quit my job throw away my phone and just live under a bridge somewhere. I’m so selfish that I wonder how long it would take before someone started to worry about me or look for me. Maybe get so fucked off I just die out there and it would be more excusable than suicide.
