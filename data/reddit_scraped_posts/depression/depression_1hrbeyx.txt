So I kind of regret it now and at the same time I think I couldn't have told her that I don't want to talk to this guy, but when I was talking to her I was more open about talking to him. But now the realization that I don't really find this guy attractive but I'm talking to him anyway will kind of just waste his time and my time. I know I could have written this better but I'm really confused, please give me some advice. And should I ask my friend to tell me more about this guy or should I just let it be? Please help.
