I've been failing my classes for years, and I seem to be especially bad at math. It's not like these classes are too hard (maybe math) but I just have no motivation or energy to get work done. I also get overwhelmed quickly so that doesn't help. I'm diagnosed with ADHD and I'm unmedicated which makes everything in my life plain difficult. I always feel like a failure but today was especially worse because I took an eye exam for Drivers Ed and I failed, the letters looked like black dots to me. Worst part, I had my glasses on. I feel like I'm a failure and my future is doomed. I won't be able to drive, I probably won't be able to get a job, if I did, I'd be miserable with it. I tried going to an alternative school but they wouldn't let me in, and despite all this, and with my failing grades, they decide it's a good idea to give me AP classes next year. This doesn't make sense to me. I wanna be in an alternative school or even SPED classes desperately so I can get extra help but no, they somehow think AP classes will somehow help. I don't know who is choosing classes for me but what the fuck are you doing? I came from 8th grade straight F's into highschool with all honors classes, who the hell thought that made any sense? Anyways, I feel like there is no hope and I don't know what to do
