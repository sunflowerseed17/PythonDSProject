I'm spiraling. It hasn't been quick or drastic necessarily but a slow decent into isolation, madness, and despair. I almost feel like it's more painful this way. I've been busy burning bridges all year. Fumbling relationships. Stock pilling regrets. I'm 28 now and I'm running out of optimism. Not consciously but spiritually. My essence is becoming increasingly more aware of the amount of opportunities l've squandered that could've or should've changed the trajectory of my future and/or current reality. I hope for my own sake I have some fight left in me but it often feels that I'm out of fucks to give... I love you tho. Thanks for reading.
