All I do is stay inside and try to avoid other people. I wear a mask if I do go outside or see people bc I'm deeply ashamed of the way I look. I have serious mental health issues and I'm alone and jobless. I am in big debt and I don't know how I'm going to pay all my bills and debt. So life is pretty shit, tbh. Sorry for ranting.
