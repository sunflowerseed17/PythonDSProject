Hi everyone, just wanted to share that I'm so restless majority of my day, it makes me just want to pace around the house and do nothing else. It's like I only feel productive when I'm moving around. I don't know how to deal with my restlessness. I've tried meditation, sleeping it off, but no luck. I am just a restless person.
