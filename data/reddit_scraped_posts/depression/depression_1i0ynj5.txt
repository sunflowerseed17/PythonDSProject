34m. I’ve had one girlfriend that I broke up with. I have maybe one friend. I live with my parents due to my major depression and bpd. When I was younger I was physically and sexually abused (not by my parents). My parents though did verbally abuse me a lot. Especially my dad when it came to school. My mom drove me to cut one day with her degrading tongue. I’ve been suicidal since 3rd grade. I don’t see any hope anytime soon.
