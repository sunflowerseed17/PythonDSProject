Not sure if this is the right place to put this but it involves not understanding social interaction so I guess so. 

Anyways this happened to me a while ago, the mother was looking at me as I ignored the kid. I’m not sure if she wanted me to say hi back or what. 

I just didn’t wanna seem weird, I’m already extremely ugly and short as a guy, so the last thing I need to be doing is talking to kids at all. I do feel bad about it though, I didn’t wanna seem mean.
