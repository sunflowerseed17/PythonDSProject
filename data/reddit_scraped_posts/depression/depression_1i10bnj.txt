Lately I’ve been feeling really depressed. I had an accident 6 years ago and I haven’t been the same. TBI and Broken Neck. I recovered well. Thank God I’m not paralyzed, but I started suffering from seizures. I haven’t had one in more than a year so that’s great but I haven’t been able to work or go to school or drive because of this. Just 6 Idle years of my life. I started going to Church in March Last Year. It was the first time I had been to church in 10 years. I have made a lot of friends. They are very caring and supportive people. I thought going to Church would help my depression but it hasn’t really. It feels like a social gathering rather than a place to go for spiritual healing. I’ve expressed to my parents and people at Church about my depression but I feel nobody really cares. I have no career goals. No plans to go to school. I want to get a job but my parents think I’m not capable enough because I have balance problems and fatigue from my accident. It also doesn’t help that I’ve never been a relationship before. Makes me feel like I’m not wanted. I feel like withdrawing from life and bed rotting rn. I also have suicidal ideation. But I don’t want to kill myself because it would make me look selfish. I sometimes wish I died in that accident.
