I often fantasize about moments where I chew my parents out. And I know how to do it in a way that would crush them. But, when I do have the rare moments that I talk to them, I hold back. I know if I said these things it would destroy me as well. It's not who I am and it's not how I want to be. I've tried talking to then about things in the past but they'd just ignore me or brish it off. My kids don't even know who they are really. And that's what pisses me off the most.

But then my brother kills himself and now they want to step up? Now they want to try? 15 years too late. Sorry. I'm not begging for a relationship with them ever again. Not ganna have my mom blow me off for a year straight ever again. I cant anymore. I cant risk anymore pain or suffering. My brain is fried and I cant.
