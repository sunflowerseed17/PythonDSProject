Everywhere I go on Reddit to talk about male looks issues I’m just gaslighted and made fun of, I’m so tired of living as a short ugly guy. No matter what I do women still will always prefer the tall white pretty boys. Why does this stupid worthless body keep functioning, why does my heart keep beating. I wish it would just stop.
