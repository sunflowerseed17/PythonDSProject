My package was sent on Dec 3 from Osaka and since that time it is stuck on the status Dispatch from outward office of exchange. 
I have received numerous packages from Japan and it never takes this long (destination is an EU country). 
Is it time to get worried and submit request for package search? It’s been full 2 weeks now …
