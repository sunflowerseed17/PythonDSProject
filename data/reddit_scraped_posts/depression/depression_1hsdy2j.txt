I have 2 moles on my neck, one is a bit lower and on the side, and the other is on the opposite side and closer to my jawline. Both are raised and I’ve honestly felt insecure about them for years. I was just wondering if dermatologists would be able to remove them for me even if they’re not cancerous and if anyone else has done this? Would you say it’s worth it, and would the marks left over be there for a long time? With it being in such visible places I just can’t get myself to feel pretty with it :(
