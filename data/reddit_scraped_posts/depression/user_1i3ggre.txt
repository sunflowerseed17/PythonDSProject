Hi.

I'm not even sure why I'm writing this but I had the urge to just write some feelings down. I feel incredibly lost and unfulfilled in my life. I have a very sedimentary life which like alot of people reading this involves waking up i go to work come home to the kids and then watch TV and sleep. 

I live in my head constantly wanting more but feel so exhausted and demotivated that I cannot bring myself to do anything.

I had children when I was 28 years old and my life drastically changed. I work days and my wife works nights so 5 days a week I come in and she leaves for work. I spent 10 years training In the evenings and the gym was my passion but with current schedules it's impossible to go.

I always feel like I am wasting so much time just sitting around bored and have never felt content and feel guilty when I relax. It's exhausting living in my head 24/7. I have also gained so much weight and am really ashamed of myself. I know I'm depressed,anxious and stuck in a massive rut. I'm 40 this year and am petrified this is the rest of my existence.

Anyone who got this far thankyou for reading.

These are just ramblings of a madman but there must be more to life.
