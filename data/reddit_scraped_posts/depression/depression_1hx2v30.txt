I know this film is often ridiculed by fans of Escape From New York as a inferior rehash. Going in the first time, I admit I disliked the film greatly. This time however, I decided to go in while keeping in mind what the joke is. Yes, Escape From LA  rehashes the old material but it aims to be so silly, it's deliberately meant to be a self-parody. Carpenter is aware of how ridiculous this scenario is. Why on earth would the US Government trust Snake again after he screwed them over the first time? John wants you to laugh at how silly this premise is. He wants you to laugh at the absurd action sequences. He is basically giving the creatively bankrupt Hollywood film industry a middle finger.  John is screaming that these idiots paid for their own trolling! Such a shame that this movie didn't find much of an audience. Anyway, Bravo Mr. Carpenter!
