Am i overreacting? Some guy tried to get my attention to hit on me while I was walking and touched me on the back, not in any inappropriate place, but it made me feel very uncomfortable, I can’t stop thinking about it. It’s not necessarily just the touch itself but his thoughts behind it that make it so weird. For context, I’m definitely not a skin ship person, never touched anybody but my mom, don’t even touch my friends. Like, who does he think he is that he can touch me? I mean, I’m not religious but in some religions the body is seen as sacred and in it’s inappropriate for a man to touch a woman.
