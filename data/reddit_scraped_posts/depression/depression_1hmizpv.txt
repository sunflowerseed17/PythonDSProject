- Purrs near you 

- Meows gently near you 

- Brushes up against you with it’s tail up 

- Sniffs you

- Let’s you pet it and pick it up, doesn’t run away

- Chases you in a playful manner if you run 

- Purposefully sleeps beside you or on top of you

The last time I was around a cat which was years ago when I was over my grandmother’s house, it started exhibiting these traits near me eventually, I can’t remember how long it took though. 

At first it would always run away from me and avoid me, then from that it would start approaching me if I was staying still and run away if I moved.
