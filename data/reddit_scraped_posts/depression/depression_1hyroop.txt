Am i overreacting? Some guy tried to get my attention to hit on me while I was walking and touched me on the back, not in any inappropriate place, but it made me feel very uncomfortable, I can’t stop thinking about it. It’s not necessarily just the touch itself but his thoughts behind it that make it so weird. He kept asking me weird questions after that. For context, I’m definitely not a skin ship person, never touched anybody but my mom, don’t even touch my friends. Like, who does he think he is that he can touch me?
