I am self reflecting atm. I feel like the biggest reason I am glued to my phone is because I don't have anything else to do.

When I discovered this, I sat up on my bed and was like "ok, so, what should I do?"

Then I began listing:
Clean. (Looks at my overwhelming messes and shuddered).
Go for a walk (I cannot stand the cold, I have low tokerance for cold temps).
Bake (Do not really have money for things atm. Food is even difficult. Transitioning between jobs and new job checks will be behind. Also not running my oven helps electricity bill stay down).

So now I'm back on my bed. Scrolling thru social media. Something free. Doesn't cost me much. Not very many cons other than bad for mental health. But, so is staring at the wall.
