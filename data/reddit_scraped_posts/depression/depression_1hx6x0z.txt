math is one of my special interests, especially calculus. i’m doing computer science in university but honestly the calculus classes have been some of my favourite. i love the way it works and i love how when you’re solving a problem, you use either one method or the other. the answer is always unambiguous which i also really like about math. calculus is especially interesting to me because no matter how complex a problem is, you still solve it using the same steps you’d use for an easier problem. i think what draws me in is the whole “steps” thing, i really like learning things in steps and it helps me organize my thoughts. anyone else have any school subjects as a special interest?
