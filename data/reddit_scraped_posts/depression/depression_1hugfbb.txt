Just a disclaimer, we've been here a year, this is our first lawn. I work a lot, have a baby. I don't have any family in my county. Don't have a dad or father figure to ask (just saying because l'm probably gonna get chewed out) Our lawn is covered in weeds. The previous residents had the lawn covered in wood chips and I think We want to go that route also. I just want to see if someone has a method (tools, techniques, terminology) for me to look into. Thank you.
