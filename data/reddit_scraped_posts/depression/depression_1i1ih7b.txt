I'm sorry that i am venting to you right now, but i cant to my friends cus they'll just make fun of me.
I am 18 years old and can't think of a Single reason for my existence. Not even one. 
I neither have any goals or dreams on my life and not a single clue what to do with my future.
I guess i have an alright social life tho.
There is nothing in my life that really makes me happy anymore, only thing that i kinda enjoy these days is smoking.
I hate to wake up everyday and just think about how i have to do the same shotty things everyday without a break, i guess i could just stop going to school because i have Sone kinda diploma but that wouldnt help since i dont know what to do with myself afterwards.

My life feels like its only one big circle that keeps repeating and it is just tiring, the thing i woulda love to do the most is just stay asleep so i dont gotta think about anything anymore.
Prolly wont do much longer.
Thanks for reading
