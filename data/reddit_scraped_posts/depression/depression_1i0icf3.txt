My parents does not like my personality, it's at the point that they hates me. And my siblings doesn't seems to get closer to me either, or they might have even developed envy towards me. I have no friends and peoples in the school bullies me initially without me knowning, until I heard gossip. My brother always taking the fact that I have no friends to talk back/attack me.

Even though at start I didn't feel anything,l just slowly become a lonely individual. I started to aware that he is right, I really don't have any friends so I just hid and cried, and my face went down for the next few weeks or around. After that phrase I just became the normal happy guy again... I certainly only want to know if I got depression or not.
