Hello there everyone! I'm currently working on a vtuber model for my twitch streams but the more I see other models I just get so discouraged.. 
It seems like the only things that get clicks nowadays are models that show skin/lewd bait/disproportionate breasts.

Please keep in mind that I am not shaming anyone who's model fits in any of those categories, I'm more so saddened that someone who's avatar won't be so flashy isn't going to get many viewers and I really don't want to resort to.. those kinds of posts. 

I don't need any answers for this, just maybe hugs.. 

Sorry about the small rant, I hope you're well ❤️
