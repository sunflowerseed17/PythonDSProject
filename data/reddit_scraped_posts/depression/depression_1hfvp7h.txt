I d'ont know why but i wanna know yalls fav starters and why cause everytime i ask that question im met with charizard and then i ask why and then they dont have a response and im fed up now tell me your faves and if you like charizard at least give me a friggin reason why you like it like it saved my nuzlocke or its design is pretty cool and to all meganium fans my heart goes out to you as its my fave cause my first johto starter was chikorita and i think its really cute and i love the entire evo line
