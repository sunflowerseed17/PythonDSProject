Have you ever been a mentally state so fucked up where you can't live you can't eat, you  can't think, you can't breathe. Everything and everyone around you is fake and the only people you might turn to either don't take seriously or you don't want them to know you're in a vulnerable state for various reasons . It's a new year in a few hours and I feel like the biggest piece of shit rn
