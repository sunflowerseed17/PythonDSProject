So I had a convo with my mom recently, basically we were talking about my childhood and how my childhood wasn’t as ideal. She would yell and get angry pretty often, comment on my body a lot and like body shame me, criticizing me a lot, stuff like that that continued as a teen as well and even as now sometimes as a young adult but not as much thankfully. So I told her she was emotionally abusive and she said that hurt her and that she was trying her best bc my dad was physically abusive so it was rlly hard for her dealing with that trauma, and I said I understand and I’m sorry that happened to her and I wish it didn’t but it’s not an excuse. 


I also feel like I need space from her because idk, it’s like because I’m the only child there’s nobody else there for her but me and it gets overwhelming when she’s lonely and always wants me around. If I’m tired after work/school I just want to be alone, but then I feel bad that she’s lonely. Also I feel like she still babies me in some ways, I’m 21 and I’m not allowed/highly frowned open to stay home from church, we go every week; or if I’m volunteering in one service (I volunteer in the church nursery) and I wanna go home afterwards she gets angry that I’m not staying to watch the 2nd service. Or like if I look depressed at church (I do have clinical depression) she’ll get angry at me so I fake being happy but then she can tell it’s fake and it makes her angry still. Anyways sorry if this doesn’t make sense, I didn’t edit this, but am I wrong for saying she was emotionally abusive growing up and for also wanting space from her even though she’s lonely as a single mom
