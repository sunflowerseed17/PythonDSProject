Hi guys!! I missed doing this <3 
Hope you all are having a holly jolly break. Today I come back with a double post

📍UTSC Marketplace, Chopsticks & Salad Bar 

🏷️ Chicken Dumplings, Salad Bowl

💵 Forgive me.. it was a while ago.. Dumplings I believe were $6.99 and salad is priced per 100g. My salad here, which filled the whole bowl and was quite heavy actually added up to about 4$. Sorry about any innacurracies! Next posts will be more recent.

⭐ 2/5 for the Chicken Dumplings. I honestly expected more, but it wasn't terrible. They were freshly made and the sauce was nice but the filling is just too.. uniform for a dumpling. It reminded me more of cheap kabab meat but not spiced like a kabab. Keep in mind, there is a fried version (ig it depends on the day which one they sell??) I didn't like that either LOL

⭐ 5/5 for the Salad Bar. THANK YOU whoever recommended I try out the salad at the marketplace, it was amazing and nobody could stop me from the ungodly amount of chia seeds I took. I love how it's fresh and you can choose whatever you'd like. It's also very diverse and not just your regular lettuce, croutons and dressing. I got a bit too excited here took a little bit of everything (and it still tasted good!) I really love the pasta salad, beans and different green leafy veggies. There's multiple dressings and toppings to choose from and it's all priced by weight. It looked healthy and felt healthy when I was eating it as well. Highly recommend even if you hate salads like me.
