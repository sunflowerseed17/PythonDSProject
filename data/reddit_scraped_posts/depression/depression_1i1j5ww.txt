I could go on and on about why but honestly I don't think this reddit post is worth the time. I spend a lot of time thinking about how good my life would be if I wasn't me, or how happy I'd be if I was someone else. I don't really know what to do. My life hasn't really gotten better the past few years and I don't see it getting better. A lot of time I just want to die, and I honestly regret not doing it sooner, for what reason have I lived the past year just for it to be worst than the last? I could say the same about the year before it. This will continue on and on until I finally do it.
