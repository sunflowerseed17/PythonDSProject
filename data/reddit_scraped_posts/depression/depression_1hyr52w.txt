I recently completed some of my first semester exams, and organic chemistry was especially challenging; I'm not even sure if I’ll pass. We only get a one-week breakw the whole second semester, during which we’ll have lectures and labs every day from 8 AM to 4 PM. I feel like I'm burning out. Do you have any advice on how to manage this? I feel like I have no time for my hobbies or to think about anything other than studying, and it's very draining.
