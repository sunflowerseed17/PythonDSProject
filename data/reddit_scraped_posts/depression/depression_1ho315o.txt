(Now kiddos this might be long but this is a story I’ve heard long ago and I still recount on this so feel free to use in YouTube and etc. please give credits if you do tho love!!! Best of luck reading <333) 

 


I’ve always hated the mirror in my grandmother’s house. Not because it was ugly—it was beautiful, actually. Ornate with curling silver frames that looked like vines, the glass always seemed impossibly clear, sharper than anything I’d seen before. But something about it was… wrong. Off.

Grandma had warned me once, years ago, when I was just a kid, never to stare at it for too long. “Mirrors see more than they should,” she’d said, her voice tight and serious. I’d laughed it off then.

Tonight, though, I can’t laugh it off.

The storm knocked out the power hours ago, plunging the house into a darkness that feels alive. I’ve lit a few candles, but their flickering light only deepens the shadows. Grandma’s away in the hospital, and I’m here alone, tasked with keeping an eye on the place.

I can’t explain why I keep glancing at the mirror. It’s like it’s calling me.

At first, it was subtle. A flicker in the corner of my eye that I told myself was just the candlelight playing tricks. But then, when I passed it on my way to the kitchen, I swore I saw something move—something that wasn’t me.

I freeze, staring into the glass. My reflection stares back, wide-eyed and pale, but there’s something off about it.

It’s not quite… me.

Her movements are slower, slightly delayed, like she’s trying to mimic me but doesn’t quite know how. My stomach twists as I raise my hand to wave, and she hesitates—just for a fraction of a second—before mirroring the gesture.

I step closer, my heart pounding so hard it feels like it might burst.

The closer I get, the more I notice. Her eyes don’t look like mine; they’re too dark, too deep, like there’s no end to them. And her mouth—oh God, her mouth—isn’t moving. She isn’t breathing.

And then she smiles.

I don’t.

Her grin spreads impossibly wide, her teeth sharp and glinting in the dim light. My stomach churns as I take a step back, but she doesn’t follow. She leans closer instead, pressing her hands against the other side of the glass.

A voice echoes in my head, soft and sweet, but it feels like claws scraping against my brain.

“Let me out,” she whispers. “I’ve been waiting so long.”

I stumble back, my legs barely supporting me. The mirror trembles, the silver frame creaking like it’s alive. I can’t move, can’t think, as cracks spiderweb across the glass.

And then she starts pounding, her fists slamming against the barrier, the sound like thunder in my ears. The glass bulges outward, like it’s made of something elastic, and I know—I know—it’s going to break.

I grab the nearest thing—a candlestick—and hurl it at the mirror. The glass shatters with an ear-piercing shriek, and for a moment, the room is silent.

But then I hear it.

Footsteps.

Behind me.

I turn, and she’s there.

Not in the mirror.

In the room.

Her grin is wider now, stretching her face into something inhuman. She tilts her head, her dark eyes locking onto mine.

“You shouldn’t have done that,” she says, her voice dripping with mock pity.

I run. I don’t look back.

As I tear through the house, her laughter follows me, echoing off the walls. It’s everywhere, inside my head, under my skin.

And when I finally reach the front door, I feel her breath on my neck.

“I told you,” she whispers, her voice cold as death. “I’ve been waiting so long.”

The last thing I see before everything goes black is her reflection in the window.

And this time, I’m the one trapped behind the glass.
