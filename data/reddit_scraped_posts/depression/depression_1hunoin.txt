Sorry it’s such a shit photo, that’s the quality I get from entering it into a calorie estimating app. The app said 600 but I want other opinions if possible. The second picture shows how deep the bowl goes. My dad cooked some curry rice and this is what I know about it:

-golden curry rice packet (1/5 of a serving is 90 cals, he used all 5. Keep in mind that was for the whole pot and this is just one bowl of it. The curry is under the lettuce as well and i got slightly more after taking this pic because it wasn’t enough.)
-carrot
-russet potato
-scallion
-rice of course: there is rice under the curry in this picture as well, pretty decent portion
-shrimp
-lettuce

Should I say 900?
