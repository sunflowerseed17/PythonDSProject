Hey guys. This may be a stupid question, but I have been wondering about this and my only bi friend could not answer me that.
I am a straight woman, and i am very insecure. When i see a pretty woman, all i can think is "i wish i had her body/hair/face/ confidence" etc. When i see a handsome man it is just appreciation for his beauty an/or sexual attraction. 
In general (if it can be something that is not particular to each individual) how do insecure women, who like women feel when they see a pretty woman? Does the insecurity talk louder than the sexuality?
