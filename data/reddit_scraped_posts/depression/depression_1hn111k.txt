So I've been playing for a while, still a beginner  and I always start lagging a lot around 1941. I know this is normal and all but is there any solution? Maybe any mods that improve how well the game runs? At the start it's acceptable at around 4-6 seconds per day but after a few years pass it's so much slower, not unplayable but pretty bad.

I also want to try playing on ironman for achievements but without debug_smooth it's pretty impossible for me to reasonably play without losing my mind. I already have everything at the lowest setting. And at 1936 without the command it's nearly 8 seconds per day.
