I've (F40) struggled with Depression since I was young, around 15. I am at the point where I feel my whole goal in life is just to remain functional in the world, keep a job, get to work, pay my bills. Since August I have noticed myself getting worse and worse - over-eating, over-sleeping, watching TV endlessly and just declining in motivation to do anything. I am on anti-depressants and see a therapist but find I hard to be honest with her about the reality of it. Anyway, I can't seem to pull myself out of it and I know I just need to go to the gym/eat well - do the things, but I can't be bothered. All I know is that I feel like it's my fault because I keep on perpetuating the same behaviour. I also feel under EXTREME pressure right now to keep this job - yet, I think I hate it.

I think I inherently believe that my depression has always been my fault - my lifestyle choices, the way I think and that I have control over it. I've had a lot of therapy and now stay away from any toxic relationships so that is a win. I don't drink anymore or smoke. I try to not fuck my life up. I am trying really hard to be 'adult' and mature and look after myself but I feel like I am failing miserably.

I live alone and I just find it really hard to want to leave the house at this point.

There are things I want - to live near Nature, to have a dog, to help others. I just feel trapped in this world right now.
