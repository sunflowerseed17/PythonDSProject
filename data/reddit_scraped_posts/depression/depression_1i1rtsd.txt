I am tired and all I want to do is sleep or watch telly! My room is a mess, I haven’t showered for 2 days now, barely leave my room. I am behind schedule for work deadlines. I work as a programmer, I haven’t even started coding for something that I need to deliver this Friday. I am on antidepressants and doc added a new one in conjunction to the one I’m taking. Been a month since I started the new one, not sure if it’s the new medication… I shamelessly do uber eats everyday ( I try to order healthy tho, like veggie bowls with good protein and so on). I don’t feel like cooking, cleaning, working! I haven’t taken a vacation outside of Canada for 5 years. Don’t so much of travelling due to this mortgage situation. I am suffocated, feel like a loser, and have no interest to live, and no courage to die!
