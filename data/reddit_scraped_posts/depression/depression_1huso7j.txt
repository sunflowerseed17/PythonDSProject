Tubing goes over the top (photo 1) just fine. But the tubing does not fit over the bottom (photo 2). It is too large! I can put my air stone directly inside the bottom but it isnâ€™t tight and gets blown off. I just had one of these setup. Am I brain dead or what is happening? Go figure what I think will take 5 minutes turns into an hours long $hit show.
