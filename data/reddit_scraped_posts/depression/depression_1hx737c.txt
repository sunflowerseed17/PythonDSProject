(If you dont like long rants, please skip to paragraph 4)


I'm sorry if this does not directly relate to ADHD, but I struggle alot with my sense of time so I'm hoping that it kind of is. Please let me know in advance if it's not I don't want to be in trouble for misunderstanding the rules


Long story short. Since the holidays I've gotten caught up with alot of stuff. Been busy since highschool graduation with many many things, especially trying to settle all this college stuff which I was extremely close to not getting in this year because of my lack of preparedness, at the same time I had minor depression for some reason midway through the start of the new year so I completly stopped talking to everyone including my friends that I knew since late pre-school and I feel so bad, what made it worse, is that I lost track of time so bad that I didnt realise that I havent talked to anyone at all in a span of 2 months


Well that random depression episode is over, and I opened up discord for the first time in two months, 348 pings, dozens of missed merry christmases and happy new years, and alot of messages asking if I'm okay and that their worried about me since I have spoke in a while.


I feel so guilty that I have just ghosted everyone i know and i didnt get to celebrate  the holidays with them this year, I feel so bad and I have no idea how to apologize because I feel like what I did is very rude and inconsiderate after all we did together
