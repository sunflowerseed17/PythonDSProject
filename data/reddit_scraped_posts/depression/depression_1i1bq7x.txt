I am not sure how to word this but its starting to feel like i don't really even care about myself or what happens to me. I am lucky that i don't have any dependants and so i don't have that burden but i its making me sick to think about the new year and new goals or trying to do anything because i just don't even care. I don't care, most days i have to force myself to even take a bath. I found these online series which was like 12 needs for any person and I've jotted them down and try to tick off everything daily, they include good sleep, exercise, bath, fun, intellectual stimulation yada yada and I've been trying to do this for a few months now but now looking at the new year it feels like i don't care anymore at all..

how do i make myself care ?
