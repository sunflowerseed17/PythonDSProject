So I started talking to this guy and we get along so great. We have things in common and he's just so nice. But I have a problem. So I am a pretty thin girl and exercise is an important part of my life, I workout almost daily every week and this guy is well a bit fat. He's not very fat but still he is a little. He has good height and facial features, he would look so good if he lost some weight, he's not extremely fat so it wouldn't even require a lot. What should I do? Please give me some advice. And also like he messaged me first and it's really quite obvious he wants to be in a relationship.
