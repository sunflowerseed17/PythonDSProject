.... I am 15 years old and my parents died in a plane crash, none of my relatives want me so I live in a dormitory. I have been subjected to violence by everyone in the dorm since I was 6 years old and my father was disgusted with me because of my vitiligo and the spots on my body. Everyone calls me 'mom' because I cover my wounds with bandages and I hate it. I think I am completely insensitive and the only girl in the dorm who supports me suggested that I seek help from this platform. The dormitory staff constantly beats me and I am harassed, there is nothing I can do. She told me to find a supportive girlfriend or I will die in an endless void. What should I do..? Can you help?...
