I hate that I’ve been on this earth for 27 years and it just feels like a prison. I’m constantly having to keep up appearances and smile and act like everything is okay even though I want to just bash my face into a mirror and I’ve done it before. I hate that I have a reputation now and people expect shit out of me. They expect me to be the smiling, happy-go-lucky person all so that their day runs more smoothly. I can’t break my facade even once because it’ll ruin everything and it’ll break the routine every one expects from me. It’s so sad that out of everyone in the room, no one thinks I’m depressed or suicidal at all. I’ve broken my character before and it never goes well.  I also hate that I have obligations to certain people now. I hate that too. 




I’m sick and tired of these expectations and I’m tired of acting fake all the time just so people aren’t inconvenienced. I’m slowly going fucking mad on the inside and I’ll just be one of those people that make people wonder why I did it. I was so happy apparently, why would I do it. I was never happy you morons. And every time I called for help, I wasn’t given the same patience. I hate being an adult and I hate how miserable my existence is.
