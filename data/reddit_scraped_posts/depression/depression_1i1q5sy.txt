I don't think that depression is remotely close to a valid medical condition. I am starting to suspect that the term was invented specifically to sell pharmaceutical drugs. I know that reading this may upset some, but I don't know how much longer I can afford to care about hurt feelings.  

If this is true, there is a great reckoning coming; something of biblical proportions.  Hopefully sooner than later!
