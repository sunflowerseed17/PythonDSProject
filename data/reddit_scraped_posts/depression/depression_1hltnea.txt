there is no album.

it's 2024 music. it's 2025 music. it's 2026 music.

it's just music and artists make way more money doing shows than from album sales. this will be milked for eternity. every single one of you is a cow bowing down to the goat.

he's timeless, he probably has given the executives his expressed permission to use his voice as ai until the end of time. the label may take his life for money very soon. be warned.
