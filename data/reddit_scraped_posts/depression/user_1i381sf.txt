i’m genuinely curious because i’m tired of this. i’m tired of being in a relationship where i constantly complain and beg for him not to talk to girls and he does it anyway. and if you’re wondering why i’m posting this on this subreddit it’s because i have severe body dysmorphia and i truly believe every girl he interacts with mogs me and is 10x prettier than me no matter what lol
