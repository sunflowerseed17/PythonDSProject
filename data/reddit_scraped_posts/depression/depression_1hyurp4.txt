I’m a 19-year-old Black guy and I’ve been thinking a lot about dating preferences lately. I come from a neighborhood where pretty much everyone is Black, so I haven’t had much exposure to people outside of my race. However, I’ve always been attracted to white girls and would really like to date one.

When I think about my future, once I become financially stable, I’d love to start a family with a white girl and have kids. But here’s my question: Do white girls really like Black guys? I’m curious about what it's like to date outside of my race, and if white girls are genuinely interested in dating Black guys, or if it’s more of a rare thing. I don’t want to come off as weird or offend anyone, but I’d like to understand how this works from the other side of things. Would love to hear from anyone with experience or thoughts on this!

Edit: Thanks to all the ones who supported me❤️❤️🫂. And well, saying I don't like pie over cake, doesn't mean I hate cake. So I don't know what's up with the ones that come up with their stupid ideas that I hate black women. Both my parents are black, my whole family is black, been dating black girls and I really loved them.
