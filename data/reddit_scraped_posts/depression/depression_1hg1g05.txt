Looking to add another color to my car(Pinstripes,Lights,etc).Its primary color is White exterior and a Black interior. Obviously just choose the color you like,that's the problem.The interior has blue show lights,a little bit of dark wood paneling,and and some gold panels.Just want to know what colors your would choose.
