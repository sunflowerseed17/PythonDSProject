Hi everyone, I just needed someplace to share my thoughts and I thought I would try Reddit. 

  
For context, I'm (20 F) on winter break from college and I go back next week. I have a diagnosed anxiety disorder which increases my risk for depressive episodes. 

This entire winter break has literally been one of the worst breaks I've experienced. My parents didn't speak to each other for 3 weeks because they got into some argument. They used to fight a lot when I was a kid, so this triggered my anxiety even there was no active fighting. After that ended, since the New Year started, I've been sick with either a cold or the flu. My entire family (my parents, brother, and grandmother) has also been sick, and things just haven't felt normal. I also started to study for the MCAT, which I need to take on the 4/4 test date, and the amount of information is so overwhelming I'm scared I'm not going to be able to take it in time. Me being sick has decreased my efficiency in studying and honestly being sick for 2 weeks straight has just been frustrating. 

The other thing, is that my brother started to have a lot of stomach pain a few days ago. My parents have been with him in/out of the doctors, hospitals etc. and they admitted him into the emergency department tonight because they think he has appendicitis. I don't want to burden them in depth with my feelings with everything that has been happening so all they've heard from me is that I feel depressed, but I don't think they understand the full extent. I feel so tired, I just want this phase of my life to be over soon. I know it won't last forever but my chest hurts.
