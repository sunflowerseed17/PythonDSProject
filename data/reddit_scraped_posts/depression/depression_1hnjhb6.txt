I’ve been trying to work towards a cleaner apartment. I have severe depression and anxiety and have adhd on top of that. For the past few years I have been completely shut down. I lived in a dorm room by myself that was awful prior to moving into my apartment. Now me and my fiancé are living together and I feel bad for him living in the state of our apartment. I usually am able to clean it up within a few days but I had about a month off of work and I feel like I’ve gotten nowhere this time. I just don’t know where to even start. I feel like I work on cleaning one room really well and then two days later it’s awful again. I normally dedicate a full day every week to just cleaning even though it takes a lot of my energy. But this time I just don’t feel like I can get it done. Our bedroom is a disaster. The kitchen sink has dishes piled up to the point that if we want to make dinner we have to wash a dish. I don’t know how long some of those dishes have been there. Would it be worth it to hire a cleaner? I don’t want anyone to have to deal with this though. I cleaned for about a week and a half so far and everything I did got undone due to holiday plans and being sick. I cleaned the bathroom like hand scrubbed the floors and walls and everything. Moved on to the entrance and the hallway and they were both so clean. It’s a mess again now. Does anyone have any tips for cleaning like this? And tips on how to keep it clean? I can clean my whole apartment and it be a disaster the next day. I don’t know what to do because I’m so cautious about messing it up and yet it’s still a mess a few days later.
