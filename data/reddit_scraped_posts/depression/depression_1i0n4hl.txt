Hello.

I'm a 30 year old guy from Belgium, and I've never felt genuinely happy. I've been bullied the second I set foot in a school, and it didn't stop until I finished it.

I've always felt disconnected from the world, from other people. I do have a few friends, but even that feels wrong somehow. It's like I don't know how it is to be human or something?

I lived at my mom's until I was about 24, then I was 'forced' to move out on my own (it was that or living with my dad, and I didn't want to do that). Living alone started somewhat nice, being free and all that, but it quickly turned into something I hated. I thought being on my own would calm me. 

In all my 30 years I've never had a girlfriend, and I keep telling myself it's because I don't love myself, I'll never be good enough for someone, and that I think I just can't do it..

When I look at my friends and what they're doing, I just break.. They all have these nice relationships, nice houses, kids.. They all seem to love everything, while I sit here alone at home, staring at my computer screen or tv, hating everything.

  
I really don't know what to do anymore, I feel like the universe made a mistake into putting me on earth.

I hope I can find some people that relate to me so we can share thoughts or.. something..
