Hi, i’ve been depressed for a few months now and am seeing a therapist. me and my friend both live together in uni with two other people we aren’t that close with. but my friend (we can call her sarah) and i are extremely close. since we moved in me and sarah have been the best of friends and her and her family all love me and she trusts me alot. i had not told sarah about my depression because i was ashamed. recently the pressure has been getting harder with assignments and a lot of my friends are dealing with issues that they confide in me. i’m always happy to listen to friends problems but recently trying to listen to everyone at once and solve everyone’s problems have become far too much. last night sarah was telling me about a problem some of her friends were having and i lashed out at her telling her to just telling me every little detail of bad stuff that happens in her life and she burst into tears and ran into her room, i chased after her to apologise but she was really upset by this. we have made up now but she is being very quite around me. i know what i did was incredibly nasty and she did not deserve it at all and i feel terrible. i’m not looking for people to tell me how horrible i am because i know how nasty what i did was but i want some advice on how i can make it up to her and make her feel like she can trust me and talk to me again. thank you
