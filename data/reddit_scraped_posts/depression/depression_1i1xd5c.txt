So...bit of a situation. I really like to go up to the top(climb that socio economic ladder) as if it is in my DNA. But this makes me to compare myself to others and this makes be feel anxious and depressed at time because I am always thinking I need to better myself and I am behind. When I try to get rid of this thought, however, I can feel my inner self saying that you are better than this, why not try more and I kinda feel useless. I am stuck between these two thoughts. If I just go status quo I just cannot get rid of this feeling that I am wasting my life away, but if I start to run, I see others running around me and I go into a full sprint mode that exhausts me and makes me depressed. Anybody in a similar situation? Anyone found answer to this dilemma?
