An old teacher of mine is getting rid of a 96 honda fourtrax for $400.400 seems really good and I hear these four-wheeler are really good themselves.This four-wheeler has 4000 miles and hasn't been riding in years,when it was,it was to haul wood in a trailer.Idk if it's 2wd or 4wd unfortunately or if it automatic or manual(Probably automatic).My only concern is how to get it home.I have a ford ranger but would it fit in the bed?What do you think about this atv?
