I wish my brain wasn’t like this, I wish I could think normally like normal people, I wish I didn’t overreact to things and then have people tell me that I’m strange or odd, I wish that I didn’t freak out internally when someone leaves me on read and feel like they’ve abandoned me, I wish I could just get over people and not be so attached to them. I wish I was a different person and I hate that I didn’t choose to have bpd yet I have to live with it and cope with it and try to heal from it. I wish I could act out and yell and scream at people but me having quiet bpd means I internalize everything until I explode and then everyone hates me or thinks I’m weird. I hate that my parents will probably never admit how much they’ve hurt me and that it’ll always be my fault and I hate my life and wish I could be someone else (pls don’t comment “oh it’s greener on the other side” because I fucking know that).
