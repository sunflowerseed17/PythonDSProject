I have a 15 GC 3.6 and want to get a muffler.Ive been looking a glasspacks(flow through) because their not crazy expensive and pretty simple.I just wanna know if anyone's ever put a glasspack on and how it turned out.Id leave the resonator on.Idc that it's a 6 cylinder,I'm not just gonna trade in for a V8.
