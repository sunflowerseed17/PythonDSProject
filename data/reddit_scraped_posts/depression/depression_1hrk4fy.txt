Just took the equivalent of 3g. All I get is sweat, indigestion, and sharpened vision. I’ve been dosing up, and it’s more of the same. I take 100mg Strattera, an SNRI. I don’t know if that’s the problem or what. I also do one 10mg edible each night for sciatica- can’t sleep a wink without it- but I’m not some heavy smoker. And I don’t drink anymore. (I took 6x of these: https://psilouette.com/products/macro-500/)
