I feel extremely disconnected to my surroundings and I WFH. I keep finding myself wishing I had more of a culture or background or some sort of identity outside of my individualism to tie me to my surroundings. I was raised catholic but I am 4th generation american danish irish and tbh I know nothing about where I came from and I deeply envy others who have families that uphold cultural practice and values. We maintained our religion but I never felt tied to that but instead ostracized by it.

Idk obviously this is tied to other issues I have with depression and anxiety and spending most of my life shunned to now being treated normal. I just wish I was grateful, positive, moving with intention and surrounded by others who wanted to make the most out of life, love and our community.

but right now i mostly feel alone despite making friends, trying my best to leave the house and putting myself out there. I don’t know what to do. How do i build meaningful community that makes me feel fulfilled instead of always mourning things before they are even over. I know I need a perspective shift but i don’t know how to change my brain like that.
