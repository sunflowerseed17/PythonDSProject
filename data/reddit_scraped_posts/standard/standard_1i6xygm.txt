I'm trying to figure out a storage solution for this cabinet at work. Ideally l'd like to be able to hang some of our heavier equipment in here to get the most out of the space. But Iâ€™m worried about destroying the cabinet which appears to be MDF

As you can see, we have a lot of heavier equipment that wouldn't normally live in a cabinet like this, but this is what I was given to work with. Ideally l'd like to hang some larger equipment hooks that support ~ 30lbslbs each in here. The higher the load capacity of potential hooks/racks, the better. 

Ideas so far would be:
1. Molly bolts or Toggle bolts through the back of the cabinet.
2. Some sort of backing board or even a wooden subframe (?)
built within the cabinet. I'm unsure of how to properly anchor a backing board or subframe to the cabinet itself if I were to go this direction.


Any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated, thanks!
