I watched the movie for the first time when I was probably 10 and LOVED it. I was obsessed with Eva Greens portrayal, and honestly the artwork of the whole film. However, in my teen years I picked up the book series and that was the fastest Ive read 6 books in my life. I cant help but feel this would make a FANTASTIC Netflix series where they do 4 episodes for each book. This whole deal seems very parallel  to what happened to Series of Unfortunate Events. A great book series, a decent star studded film that appeased newcomers but not hardcore series fans, and then a fan service tv series that did the books justice and expanded further into the stories and characters. Fingers crossed for this sometime in the next decade haha.
