**Hi everyone!**  
Iâ€™m planning to build a new PC and would love some advice to make the most of my budget. 

Here are my requirements and preferences:

# Usage:

1. **Work-related tasks:**
   * Running 1-2 Virtual Machines (Windows and/or Linux) using VMware/VirtualBox.
   * Light Docker usage (1-2 containers).
   * Specific work software that consumes **5-6GB of RAM**.
   * I need an **NVIDIA GPU** for tasks like cracking/AI workloads.
   * Dual boot (Windows + Linux).
   * Coding (XCode, Android Studio with Emulator, VSCode plugin, etc)

I will not use everything at the same time XD

1. **Gaming:**
   * I play games like **Apex Legends**, **Counter-Strike 2**, and **Sea of Thieves** on a **1440p 144Hz monitor** that I already own.

# Preferences:

* **GPU:** Iâ€™ve been advised to focus on an **NVIDIA 4070 Super or 4070 Ti Super**. Do you agree with this choice?
* **CPU:** Iâ€™m leaning towards **AMD Ryzen** (likely a Ryzen 5 or 7), but Iâ€™m a bit lost among all the versions. Any specific recommendations that pair well with the GPU?
* **Storage:** 1TB is enough for me.
* **Aesthetics:** I donâ€™t care much about flashy designs. I prefer a **minimalist look**.

# Budget:

Iâ€™m aiming for around **â‚¬2000**, but Iâ€™m willing to go slightly higher if the improvements are worth it.

# Example Build:

Hereâ€™s an example Iâ€™ve made that seems to fit my needs:

Would this be a good choice?  
Are there better configurations I should consider?   
Could I spend less on one side to improve CPU and/or GPU?  
Do you see products that are not compatible? or overpriced?

Thank you in advance! ðŸ˜Š
