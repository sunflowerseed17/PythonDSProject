Ok so the situation for me is that I had Ahri hovered and I was also first pick, so no excuse of not wanting enemy team to get it. The support player (who picked Katarina btw) banned it. I said in chat, wtf you banned my hovered pick? and he said "whoospie :)" .... i just shook my head and called him something I won't repeat here. I picked a different champion and continued on, and we won the game. I did not int, I did not troll, even though this support kat ended up dying like 15 times, we did win the game. 

  
I received a warning for being abusive towards this person in champ select, which is fair enough, I was abusive. Is there any point in me reporting this guy? Or is this a troll loop hole where if you feel like being a dick or aren't happy about being auto filled (he didn't say he was but I'm guessing) then you can just do this and hope someone dodges or something?
