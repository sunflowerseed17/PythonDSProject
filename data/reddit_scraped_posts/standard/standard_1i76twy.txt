Don't know where else to post about this, don't really think I *can* post about it anywhere else, and maybe it's a bit stupid but...

People that do these always, and I mean ALWAYS, do progress updates, post videos, make no real effort to hide who they are behind the screen, and because of this they ALWAYS get C&D'd before they release it and all their work is for absolutely nothing.

I've seen so many projects like this fail, mainly Nintendo ones, because they just couldn't help but be excited about it and post all about it on the internet, getting the attention of the company's legal team to then threaten them so they can't do anything more with it.

So... why not just, out of the blue, on a few random forums using alt accounts, suddenly upload it when it's done? So it's just out there on the internet immediately, there's significantly less chance of them finding out who you are, and because it's already out there there's nothing for them to C&D.  
Now granted I don't know legal stuff like... at all, and maybe this would be a terrible idea because they would just go right past the C&D to suing you for everything you have and utterly destroying your life.

Would it be better for them to just do it like this? Just a sudden release when it's done instead of advertising all over the internet that they're violating the company's copyright?
