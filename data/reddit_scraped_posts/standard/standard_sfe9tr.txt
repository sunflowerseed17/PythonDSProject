I'm trying to split several Excel work sheets in to separate workbooks, the columns requiring split are variable depending on info needed.  
I've tried various VBA's without much success, mainly because I'm not that clever with such things. (my attempts end up with syntax errors, compile errors, refusing to run etc etc)

I've come across loads of add ins which will split into sheets on the same workbook, but the numbers of results mean that creating new copies in a new workbook is very time consuming.

I was watching a [Mr Excel video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gV30MeZwM) which mentioned an add-in called WBmerge. This looks like the answer to my problems. The download is for a set up file, but it would appear the host website no longer exists, and searches only come back to links for the set up exe.

Does anyone know if the add in still exists or where it can be downloaded?

If not can someone point me to an easy to understand and modify VBA script to split sheets into workbooks?

Thanks for your assistance!
