Everything is built/wired together except a GPU which I havenâ€™t bought yet. Originally was going to go with the RX 7800 XT but can anyone recommend me a cheaper GPU to go with this budget/mid build. I have gone with the Ryzen 5 7600X CPU, 32gb DDR5 RAM for context, Gaming Pc will be used for gaming (not exceptionally heavy gaming but daily), games such as COD WZ/Fortnite and generally anything. Help appreciated :)
