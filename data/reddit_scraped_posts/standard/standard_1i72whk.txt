My first post y'all dogged me because it didn't have serenity (Pic 1 is what I showed). After some tears and listening to you guys I spent 5 hours tonight breeding the new ones (Pics 2, 3, and 4).

I only have enough materials to fully max one of them out right away so which one should it be? I'm looking for the best DPS set up. Hopefully I don't disappoint this time around lmao.
