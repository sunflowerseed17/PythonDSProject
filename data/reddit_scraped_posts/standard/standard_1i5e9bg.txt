I'm not American so maybe it's adding to my confusion.

I know that the Republicans originally wanted the app banned. Then, I believe(?) Joe Biden's government further pushed for it to be banned, unless it could be sold to an American company (with no buyers). But I read that TikTok put out a message that said ["As a result of President Trump's effort's, TikTok is back in the US".](https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/5f2287dd-bf18-47f2-958a-4a213dd3cf69/tiktok-1-abc-gmh-250119_1737314759129_hpMain.jpg?w=750) I saw that Trump posted [SAVE TIKTOK](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2025/01/19/trump-vows-hell-save-tiktok-from-ban-heres-what-he-can-and-cant-do/), but how could he "save" TikTok if he's not currently the president?

I know Elon has been associating himself with Trump, and I've read opinions that Zuckerburg's Meta policy changes seem to be a way to cozy up to Trump. Is that this is?
