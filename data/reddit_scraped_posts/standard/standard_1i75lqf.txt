The first picture i took of this was in 2017 of funny shape sauce on a plate , second picture is my friends random generated survival world , i was just exploring the right side of my spawn location and casually filling up the map , until i finished it and instantly recognized the shape , might be far fetched but this looks so alike and is so unique to me that i instantly knew what picture i was thinking of.  Btw im not the seed owner this is my friend world , 2025 1/21 11pm
