New homeowner and DIYer here. Our house is built on the side of a hill with a walkout basement in the back. On the first floor our kitchen overhangs the basement by about 2 feet. Water supply lines for the kitchen sink run up the joist bay in the overhang, offset from the body of the house. With freezing temps, this area got really cold and pipes froze (luckily I caught it in time to pump heat before any damage was done). When investigating, I noticed cold air is getting in through holes in the overhang. There is no insulation in the joist bay so the pipes are completely exposed to the cold air coming in through the overhang. Is this as simple as caulking the holes and shoving insulation back there, or should we be considering something else. TIA!
