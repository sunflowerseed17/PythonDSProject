So for context me and everyone in this story are young (15) me and my ex we’ll call her Jane (ex) dated for about four months in 2022 me and my current girlfriend we’ll call her grace (gf) began dating last year in February so our one year is coming up. Me my girlfriend and my ex all go to different schools but go to the same place after so they became friends and eventually I became friends with Jane (ex) again recently Jane (ex) told grace (gf) that she liked her and grace told me what she said and asked me not to talk to Jane about it however I was understandably pissed at her and did message her I was rude and just asked her to apologise to to grace as she was panicking over what happened or so I thought so I chatted to Jane about it I wasn’t rude to her I was polite and just reminded her of boundaries. A bit late grace started to message me going on about how I shouldn’t have done what I did and that now it was going to be awkward between them and that I shouldn’t have done it as now Jane was crying over it. So my question is am I the ass hole or could I have handled this better
