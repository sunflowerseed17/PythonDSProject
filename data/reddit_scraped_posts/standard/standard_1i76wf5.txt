I just started playing wow classic hardcore and I have a lot of question 

I’m playing a warrior and a lot of people say that weapon progression is everything 
But when i look att the weapons I need they are most of the time really for a way to buy or the quest for the weapon is far away 

For example, I’m a orc and when I hit lvl 6 I want to get the goblin smasher weapon. But the quest for the weapon is really far away 

Do I still walk and try and get it or what do I do ?
