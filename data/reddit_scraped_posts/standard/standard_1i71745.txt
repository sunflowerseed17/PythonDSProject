I want to give Classic WoW a go. I didn't play WoW growing up. I only played Dragon Flight a couple of years ago and mostly just did quest. I want to play as many characters in classic WoW and experience as many as possible of the different race/classes there is to offer. 

What are some fun and not so fun Race/Classes you've come across?   
What is a good game goal to work towards in that setup?

What are somethings to keep in mind while playing as a Hardcore character?

Feel free to drop any tips or suggestions!

Something to add, I do plan on sharing my "new player experience" on some platforms. Created fresh accounts today ( not the ones linked to this account not sure if self reporting is frowned upon or if its against the rules ), and the idea is to levels as many characters as possible and share each experience. With the Community  choosing which character to do next. Being someone who knows very little about WoW let alone playing on a Hardcore in Classic, I assume it would be a interesting ride.
