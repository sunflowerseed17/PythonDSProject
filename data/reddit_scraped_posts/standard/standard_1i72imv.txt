Title: [Aldridge] In the interim, Phoenix also has to find a way to move veteran center Jusuf Nurkić, and to do that, the Suns will likely have to attach a future first-round pick with him to get a team to take on Nurk’s $19.3 million for 2025-26.

>The Suns have a lot they’re trying to accomplish by the Feb. 6 trade deadline. First, of course, is figuring out a way to get Butler from Miami – but that is still contingent on getting Beal to waive his no-trade clause to facilitate any deal with the Heat, whether a two-team or multi-team deal.   
  
In the interim, Phoenix also has to find a way to move veteran center Jusuf Nurkić, and to do that, the Suns will likely have to attach a future first-round pick with him to get a team to take on Nurk’s $19.3 million for 2025-26. With the three firsts from Utah, the Suns can now avoid the Stepien Rule and trade a first in any of the next six drafts (but, still, not in consecutive years). By turning one (unprotected) first into three picks, Phoenix has a little more flexibility to get into more potential deals — and more inventory to put into a Butler trade.

The current rumor for the Beal/Butler trade is a 4-team deal involving the Heat, Bucks and Suns, with Toronto as a facilitator.  Assuming the Raptors also plan to take on Nurkic's contract in a separate deal (Phoenix cannot aggregate players as part of the 2nd apron's various restrictions), one of Kelly Olynyk or Chris Boucher matches the necessary incoming/outgoing salary per the rules regarding salary matching for incoming/outgoing salary.

Davion Mitchell - who is on the final year of his rookie deal - can also be fitted into a Nurkic deal with either one of Boucher or Kelly.
