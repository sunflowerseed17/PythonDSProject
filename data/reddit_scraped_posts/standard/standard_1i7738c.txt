I bought a workstation at the end of 2022 for about 330 AUD (205 USD).  
The specs are:

Xeon e5 1650 v3  
Quadro m6000 12GB  
32gb ddr4 2133mhz  
240 GB SATA SSD (I think it was intel but I forgot)

this is all in an HP z640 workstation

I was originally only considering selling the gpu to upgrade it. But now I'm not sure whether I'd be bottlenecking with the CPU that I have. For context, I barely use this workstation for any workstation-like activities, I have a 1080p 165hz monitor, and I play a lot of PCVR. So, should I sell the GPU, or would I be better off selling the entire PC and then building/buying one?

TLDR - Am I better off selling my GPU or entire PC? I play pcvr and am worried that my CPU could bottleneck my future GPU.
