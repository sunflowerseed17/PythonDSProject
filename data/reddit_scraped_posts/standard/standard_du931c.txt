 Hi, I'm running Office 365. I copied some info from a webpage to excel. This included a single hyperlink in the cell data. Is there a way to add more hyperlinks so that this single cells data, Just a specific reference number, opens 4 separate but related web pages? I can edit the hyperlink by right clicking (link doesnt show in Formula Bar), I tried simply entering a comma and the second link but that didn't work.

Any help gratefully received!
