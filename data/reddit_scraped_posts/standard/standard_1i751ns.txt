So, I have this cat, Whiskers. Cute, fluffy, slightly evil. He’s obsessed with knocking my water glass off the nightstand like it’s his personal life mission.

Enter: Me. Genius human with a degree in engineering. I decided to 3D print a special cup holder that clamps to the nightstand and securely holds the glass. Problem solved.

Or so I thought.

Last night, I woke up to the sound of something rattling. I squint into the dark, and there’s Whiskers. He’s sitting next to the cup holder, pawing at the water glass like it’s a puzzle. After a few moments of intense concentration, the little menace used his teeth to lift the entire glass out of the holder and proceeded to dump it on the floor, all while maintaining eye contact.

I’m now wondering if I should hand over my degree, build him a tiny diploma, and rename him Professor Whiskers.

TL;DR: I tried to out-engineer my cat. My cat engineered revenge.
