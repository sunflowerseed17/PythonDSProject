In all fairness, it is tiny. Picture a grain of sand of a diamond (I don't even know if it's a diamond) as a solitary. I'd never say that without having been asked, and even then, I would've said something to change the subject or flat-out lie and say it's the most gorgeous engagement ring of all time.

Except for the fact that I got engaged two months ago, and my fiancee got me a moonstone ring because that's my birthstone, and that's WHAT I WANTED. My cousin simply couldn't accept that and kept going on and on about how diamonds are emblematic of engagement rings and that my fiancee just "cheaped out."

Imagine my surprise when she posts her engagement announcement on insta and her precious diamond is almost invisible. I don't think words can describe how small it is. Whatever you're imagining, it's smaller.

I congratulated her on her post and thought of leaving it at that, but she DMed asking what I thought, so I just asked if that's the size she wanted, and that turned into a full-blown dumpster fire. She got the rest of the family involved and now I'm "bullying her." Really can't see how.
