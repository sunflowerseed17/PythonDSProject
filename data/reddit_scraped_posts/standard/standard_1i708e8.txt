I (19F) have been living with my roommate (18F) since the beginning of the Fall semester. In the first few weeks, things were fine, but over time, we became distant and passive-aggressive about our shared space. I have acute migraines and need the room pitch black to sleep, as any light triggers migraines. I’ve talked to my roommate multiple times about this, and while she seemed to understand, lights continued to be left on, including her extremely bright alarm clock.

I tried to handle it and sleep with some lights on, but she then brought in a new light that illuminated the whole room in purple, adding to the already bright alarm clock. One night, I tried to wake her up to talk about it, but she was asleep, and I couldn’t turn the light off. After waiting a couple of hours for it to turn off on its own (it didn’t), I unplugged it. I planned to talk to her about it in the morning, but when I woke up, she had left for class and left a note saying I needed to stop touching her stuff, and that the light would have turned off on its own.

I didn’t think much of it and decided to discuss it with her later. When she came back, she immediately started complaining about me touching her things, saying she likes having a light in the room, and that she’s had to compromise on everything. She mentioned how she likes keeping the window open at night, and I always close it because I’m afraid of break-ins. She also mentioned hating my curtain that blocks sunlight (the one she said I could have), and how I turn off her fairy lights at night, which I did to reduce light when she was asleep.

She argued that the new light wasn’t facing me, so it shouldn’t be an issue, but it was still bright enough to illuminate the whole room. I tried to explain that this wasn’t just about comfort—it’s a medical issue for me, and the lack of sleep is affecting my migraines and school performance. She didn’t seem to understand and kept insisting that I need to compromise now.

I understand she feels like I’m not letting her use her lights, but my sleep is being severely impacted, and I’m struggling with migraines and poor mental health because of it. So, AITA for turning off her lights so I can sleep?
