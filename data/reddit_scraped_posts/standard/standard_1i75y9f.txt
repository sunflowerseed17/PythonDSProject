In total there are 19 hangout quests(noelles is counted separately). The last hangout quest was released in 4.5 with lynette hangout. It seems hoyo is slowly pushing hangout quests aside for other things which is annoying. And before yall say "oh but obviously its gonna take alot of time they have to make 5-6 different endings for the chacters" my response to you is  in version 3.5-3.8 they released one hangout for each version(3 with 5 endings one with 6 endings) while also managing to release the continuation of dain lore, the final addition to the desert and a full fledged story for the summer event. Yes ik it was already planned and written months in advanced but it wouldn't hurt hoyo just to add a hangout quest every 2-3 versions like i would love a hangout with gaming where he teaches us to lion dance, a hangout with sara where she shows us the secrets of the three commissions or smth, a hangout with collei where we meet her in mondstad with amber and have fun there are literally so many possibilities and its sad to see it getting pushed aside as this is probably one of the only ways for more 4 star lore
