This was a few weeks after I bought the game and I was 9 or 10 years old at that time. I saw a video on YouTube of someone making a portal. I tried to replicate it in the game (in creative mode) and it worked! I got exited and went in... And that iconic sound of nether loading came... And I almost pissed myself. I got so scared, i started crying, threw my laptop and went and hugged my mother and didn't touch the game for a month. Also this was before the texture update and the old netherrack texture added to this reaction
