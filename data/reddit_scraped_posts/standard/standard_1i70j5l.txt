I’m really interested in watching some romance films that aren’t like Hallmark or romcom. I want something that will break my heart and then put it back together in the end. I really like the vibes of the second half of the movie Waves. I thought their story was just everything I need in a movie and I want to find some films exactly like that so if anyone has any, please feel free to share (but I also don’t want any like common answers like Before Sunrise or any other films like that I’m looking for something more hidden and unknown)
