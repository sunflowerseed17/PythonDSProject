TL;DR: My girlfriend has a close male friend she met on a dating app, and their dynamic feels more than platonic (daily messages, shared bed, his jealousy when she mentions other guys). She denies anything romantic and justifies his behavior as "that's just how he is." I asked her to distance herself, but she only spoke to him, and he reassured her nothing is going on. I still feel uncomfortable and want to ask her to take real distance or reconsider our relationship. AITA for setting this boundary?


Here’s the full context:

- She met him on a dating app 2y ago.

- They dated for a couple of months (sex included), but according to her, nothing romantic developed.

- They call their hangouts "dates" as a joke.

- He gets visibly upset or negative when she mentions other guys or expresses attraction toward someone else.

- She’s told me he actively discredits people she dates and avoids talking about her relationships with her.

- They message each other daily, often late at night, and she uses affectionate nicknames for him.

- Before we were a thing, she was ok with sleeping in the same bed as him. I had to bring it up to convince her she shouldn't do that anymore and she promised she won't.


I brought up my concerns, explaining how this dynamic feels like more than just a friendship and that it makes me uncomfortable. I’ve also pointed out how his behavior — such as jealousy and avoidance of certain topics — strongly suggests he has feelings for her.

She admitted that:

- It’s difficult to talk to him about her relationships because of how he reacts.

- He’s made dismissive comments about people she’s dated.

- She avoids mentioning certain things to avoid conflict.


However, she insists there’s nothing romantic between them because "if he wanted something, he would have said so by now." She justifies some of his behaviors as "that’s just how he is" and doesn’t see anything wrong with their level of closeness.

I asked her to create some distance, as their dynamic feels inappropriate to me. She agreed to “take a step back” but later told me she spoke to him, and he reassured her there was nothing strange about his intentions, adding that "they didn’t fall in love when they first met, so nothing romantic will happen."

To me, this doesn’t solve the issue. His words don’t change his actions, and I still feel their closeness crosses the line of what's appropriate in a committed relationship. I want to have another conversation with her to clarify my feelings. I’m considering saying something like this:

"I’ve tried to explain why his behavior bothers me, and I know it’s hard for you to see it from my perspective. Still, this situation isn’t working for me. I need you to take concrete steps to show that your connection with him is purely platonic. Please take real distance from him for the sake of our relationship. If you can’t do that, then I’ll have to assume that what you have with him matters more than what we have."

AITA for wanting her to distance herself from him and being firm about this boundary?
