I’ve gone through and thoroughly done as much of Act 1 I think is possible, ending my group at level 7 and a half, and just got the Blood of Lothander. Since I think it’ll be good for act 2 I wanted to change Shadowheart’s stats since I’ve given her the dex gloves and I’ve heard there’s a medium armor that gives full dex bonus to ac. I’m going to make dex a second dump stat so I can make use of the new mace and get a bunch of strength. But I want to also change her domain because so far Trickery domain has been really useless. Until now she’s been mostly forced to be support, I want to make the most of the mace. So which domain would be best? For more context my party is Thief Rogue Astarion, Berserker Barbarian Karlach and me as a Wild Sorcerer.
