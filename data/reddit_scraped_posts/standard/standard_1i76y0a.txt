Hi, I have about. £5,500 saved to buy my next system. I am awaiting 5090 builds to become available and am seriously looking at a chill blast systems like the obsidian or  similar.

I currently have a 4080/32gb/ryzen 7945hx ROG laptop and a 2080ti/32gb/i9 desktop (will be giving the 2080 system away to a friend when the time comes)

I’m seriously considering a chillblast system like the Obsidan but with the 5090 when it’s available to order. I like my 2080 desktop buts it’s SO LOUD I want t go for a quieter water cooled system. Am I correct here water cooled systems generally quieter? 

The other question I have is 6000mt/s ram upgrade worth it over the 5600 ram? 

And yet another question is are chillblast the best prebuilt to go for? I hear good things about them in comparison to Alienware.

Thanks in advance
