So, long story short. I bought the ASUS maximus z790 dark hero and for whatever reason I can’t connect to ethernet or wifi. Never encountered an issue like this before. I went to my bios and checked my onboard device configuration and made sure my intel LAN wasn’t disabled which it wasnt. And I went to my network settings on windows and I see no sign of a ethernet connection..

I never had this issue with past motherboards. I install them, connect them to my Ethernet and work like a charm. I looked everywhere and can’t find anything to help with this. I’m hoping someone here can give some insight.
