So I've lived in my home for about 15 years. When we first moved in we had a usable tub upstairs but over the years the paint job on the tub started to chip, come to find out the old owners painted it with freaking house paint. In the last few years we just stopped using it because it was falling apart.
I really want to take a bath in my own house so I was like "eh, how hard can it be? I've stripped furniture". First mistake was using Citrus strip because it's what I had on hand. I hate that stuff, I don't know why I always go back to it, it's so awful. It's made a huge mess, where should I go from here aside from cleaning whats been left?
