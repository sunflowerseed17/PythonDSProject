Playing lol this evening with my husband and we encountered an entire team who was AFK from start to finish. Our team just took down every turret until we won. Everyone on the enemy team all had very similar usernames as wellâ€¦ and they spawned in as level 2 when we saw them at their base? Is this some kind of thing anyone else has encountered? I tried to report them at the end and for some reason the stats screen never loaded, which heightened my feeling of some kind of cheating going on or maybe it was just the server.
