Hey guys I’m on episode 334 I’ve been watching on Netflix this whole time. But I just realized looking at all the episodes how many episodes are skipped, even up until the point where I’m at in the anime. I didn’t even notice I missed the episodes til I looked at the episode list. Were those just filler episodes that they left out or?
