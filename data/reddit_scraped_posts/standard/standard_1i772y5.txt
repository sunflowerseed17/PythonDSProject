This theory came to me after I played and finished the game as an illithid Durge that just decided to end it all. By the end, Withers himself swoops in and greets you in the Fugue Plane, surprised to see you there. He notes that, despite saying earlier at the end of act 2 that illithid souls are destroyed during ceremorphosis, we seem to still possess one. [You can see this here](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=OHljLbK54iw&pp=ygUcd2l0aGVycyBmdWd1ZSBwbGFuZSBpbGxpdGhpZA%3D%3D). However, it is established in Forgotten Realms canon that illithids do possess souls - they can become liches, after all, through a transformation which necessitates having one and they can also be restored with [Wish](https://youtu.be/LI4v6hC_rjM?si=EGA5Oyzqai5l6fa-) which wouldn't be possible if their souls were eradicated. 

*I think, this isn't a contradiction with established lore but just a case of Withers not having all the information!*

Gods in Forgotten Realms are neither omnipotent, nor omniscient. Withers, as the former god Jergal, only has intimate knowledge with the Fugue Plane where souls land and await their judgment and their gods to bring them to their respective realms. Canonically, the intellect of illithids, maybe along with their souls, gets assimilated by an Elder Brain upon their death and they never arrive at the Fugue Plane, leaving Withers blind to these facts. 

Withers therefore had no idea where the souls went, leaving him to assume that they were destroyed. We might actually be the very first illithid in history that arrived in the Fugue Plane (possibly because there are no Elder Brains left in our plane of existence or maybe even all of existence?), which is why Withers was so surprised to see us and why he corrected himself in the end. 

So, yeah, I think this isn't the case of Larian making up stuff and contradicting established D&D lore. I think this is legitimately just a case of an unreliable narrator who doesn't have all the information telling us a mistaken lie that he had previously assumed to be true and then later corrected himself. 

That's just my interpretation, at least.
