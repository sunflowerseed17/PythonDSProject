Hello guys, and thanks for your help. 

 I would like you to know my specs:

MOBO: MSI MAG X570 TOMAHAWK WIFI (PROBLEMATIC ?)
CPU: AMD 7 5800x  
GPU: Radeon RX 6700 XT
PSU : Corsair 750xm (i think or something very similar, i will double check tonight)
RAM (irrelevant but its very high end)
M.2 and SATA SSD

I have a 450/500 MAX MAX euro budget to change whatever needs to be changed. What would you recommend I do to get the best value for the money? i would like to upgrade to the AM5 socket with a brand-new CPU, MOBO, and RAM.  i do not wish to change the GPU for now as it works just fine.

Bear in mind, please, that I will most likely sell the whole PC in 3 years to build a new one from scratch.
