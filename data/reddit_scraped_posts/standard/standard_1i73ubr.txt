Just randomly popped in my head watching sugar. Definitely a *thing* as a lot of times the characters seem a little out of place.

I really enjoy it because most of them give great performances, it's just something I wondered.

I was thinking probably 28 days later cause thats the earliest major role I seen a black British women getting before there were a lot more getting casted.

And her role in that movie was really excellent.
