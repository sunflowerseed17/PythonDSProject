I do apologize but this will be a copy and paste because my grandma texted me this just ten minutes ago. Ok.  'My brother Preston was like 3 years old before he really talked.  Mom thought he was unable because he would just make different noises and point and everyone would jump and get him what he wanted.  Then one day he was chasing the cat around the house, game he and the cat played, and she ran down the basement steps.  He stood at the basement door and as clear as a sunny day he yelled,"Cleopatra Kitty Nichols you get up here!". Shocked the heck out of Mom.  He could talk but why do it if all he had to do was point and make a noise and everyone jumped.  Not saying that is the case here with Luna (my daughter) but, each child is an individual and will progress on their time.  I think it's cool you are teaching her sign language though.  There's a future job there for her.' 
I couldn't help but laugh at how funny this was but I love my grandma and how understanding she is and how I'm able to talk to her about anything.
