Am I the asshole? I've been dating in now, officially going out with a girl that I've known for three months now and I've noticed that she has an uncomfortable amount of guy friends. At first, this did not bother me, but as we got deeper into our relationship, I noticed the consistency of the text messages basically all day every day with one guy she apparently has known them for 10 years and and he's coming down during the summer and I'm expected to meet them. I am no way trying to control her, but I have a bit of boundaries that most men I think would agree with I don't appreciate her texting another man every single day telling him I love you and their text messages, posting him on her spam page posting their text messages And as soon as I leave for work, calling him on the phone immediately after I leave and when I express myself nothing changes and I look like the asshole. She has asked several people about this, including her father, and he agreed with me saying that he would not feel comfortable about his wife contacting a male friend every single day, and calling them every single day Yet I see no attempt to change it. I'm not saying you block this guy, but I am saying set some boundaries. Let them know that you have a boyfriend and you wanna respect a relationship. She recently made a post where she posted. Several pictures in the second one is us and the very last one is a text message from earlier tonight on the post now am I the asshole for wanting this communication to significantly change or should I just end it or should I give it some time? What are your thoughts willing to hear anything you got?
