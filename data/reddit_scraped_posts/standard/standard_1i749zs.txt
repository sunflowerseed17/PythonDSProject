Not sure if this breaks the rules or not, but I was just curious.

I often watch older shows and movies on tube TVs for the nostalgia, but it's becoming increasingly harder to find the non-widescreen, upscaled, or remastered versions of specific shows or movies. I've used archive, which has had some success, but more often than not if it's the older version it usually isn't in English or has ads / watermarks baked in. 

Is there a good source for specifically the older versions of media, preferably from VHS copies if possible? I understand this is niche, but any advice would be appreciated. Not being widescreen is a very important part of this.
