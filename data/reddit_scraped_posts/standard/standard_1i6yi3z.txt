So, I know we all love a good coming of age film because we’ve all been through that tough stage of going from childhood to adulthood.

Well…are there any like that for adults who still haven’t quite figured it out? I’m 27 and have no direction and am about as lost as I’ve ever been. I can’t really relate to a movie about a kid ten years younger than me trying to decide if they should go to college or pursue their dream or whatever.

I would love a movie recommendation where a grown ass adult has to kind of come into the next stage of their life, however it might play out (hopefully happily dear god let it be happily)
