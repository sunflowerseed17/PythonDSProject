I’ve (35F) been with my boyfriend (35M) for two years, and for the most part, our relationship has been good. He has a female best friend, let’s call her Lena (38F). For the first year, everything seemed fine—I didn’t think much of their friendship, except I did notice she would blow up his phone on our days together. 

One night, while we were all out drinking, he said something that set off alarm bells. He told Lena he could “please her better in bed than her current fling.” This led me to ask if they had any history, and he admitted they had dated briefly. According to him, she rejected him in a very cruel way (the details of which I’d rather not share). I asked why he would keep someone who rejected him in such a manner and he said she had apologized and had been a true friend since then (it happened five years ago). I let it go, though it still bothered me a little.

Fast forward to a month ago, I noticed I couldn’t see his Instagram story one evening, even though it said he had posted one. Turns out, he had reposted something from Lena’s page, but she had hidden me from viewing her stories. When I asked him to show me what it was, it was a picture of them together at his work (a bar)—with his hand around her waist.

At that point, I set a boundary: I told him I wasn’t comfortable with the dynamic anymore. Specifically, I asked that she no longer join our hangouts and that he avoid answering her calls when we’re spending time together. He agreed and said he understood, explaining that both he and Lena tend to distance themselves from each other when they’re in relationships. However, this isn’t just a casual or temporary relationship—we’ve talked about marriage and kids, so when and where does this end exactly? 

Despite agreeing to my boundary, he kept insisting that I must have done something to make Lena dislike me or feel the need to hide things from me…this left me feeling confused, as I’ve always tried to welcome her and make an effort to get to know her. He even mentioned that he’s known her longer than me and feels a responsibility to defend her because of their history.

Now, I feel crazy—physically sick even. I’ve never felt this way in a relationship before, and honestly, I don’t think I can stay in this relationship if she’s going to remain a part of his life.

Am I the asshole?
