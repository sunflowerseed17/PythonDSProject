I was diagnosed with T2 a few years ago. I'm taking metformin predominantly to treat it, with empagliflozin and Aloglitin

However I have absolutely no idea on a day to day level on what I should regard as symptoms. My overall life and health doesn't feel any different to pre diagnosis or pre medication. I'm told my sugars spiked very high and was recently put on a three month course of the Aloglitin. Again, if docs hadn't done annual check I would have had no idea.

Is there a blood test device I can get to track high sugars? In the UK I could get a free one if I was T1 but apparently not for T2.

Additional, am overweight and find it very difficult to lose weight, both sides of the family are the same. Fathers father was also diagnosed with Diabetes only discovered after a stroke at age 54 though I don't know if it was T1 or T2, though as he had no idea he was I'm assuming T2 ( I will be the same age as him 4 years)

My diet is reasonable and doc considers it controlled, don't drink much these days either.

So what evidence am I looking for that makes T2 obvious in daily life?
