I while ago I read about a new TV show "[The Hunting Party](https://www.pogdesign.co.uk/cat/The-Hunting-Party-summary)" where the synopsis is "Follows a small team of investigators who are assembled to track down and capture the most dangerous **huggers** our country has ever seen, all of whom have just escaped from a top-secret prison that's not supposed to exist."

I thought ok that's pretty weird a show about chasing "huggers", I was thinking some weirdos go around hugging people without consent, and go to jail for it or something. I decided not to watch the show and forgot all about it.

But just now I saw a second show about huggers! "[The Crow Girl](https://www.pogdesign.co.uk/cat/The-Crow-Girl-summary)", with synopsis "When the bodies of unidentified young men start to show up around the city, beaten and full of the anaesthetic lidocaine, DCI Jeanette Kilburn and partner DI Lou Stanley are on the hunt for the **hugger**. .... But with the **hugger** inching ever closer to home, Jeanette and the team are in a race against time to untangle the web of secrets to solve this mystery.

Now I am thinking wtf, does hugger mean something else? Or is criminal hugging a thing? Or am I missing something completely.
