Hi, as the title says im looking to upgrade my rig but I haven't been following pc news/new releases for quite a while so i'm not too sure where to start? I will be using the pc generally only for gaming in 1440p. The things I would like to have are a motherboard that is ATX compatible and has two m.2 slots, ddr5 support and an cpu that is superior to the i7-8700k. 

I am only looking to upgrade my cpu, motherboard and memory since I already have a 750w gold rated psu and rtx 4060. My budget is in the ballpark of 600ish Euros.
