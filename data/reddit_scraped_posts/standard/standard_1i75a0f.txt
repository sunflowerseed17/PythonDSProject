I will be building a new PC soon and I already have this PSU so I was wondering if I can use it to power my next PC (7700x, 4060 (or potentially 5060 when it comes out), 32gb ddr5 ram, 2x nvme ssd)
On PSU calculator by Xtreme vision (iirc) it said I needed around 440W PSU minimum.
Also I put the specs kinda overkill (such as USB devices, fans, a GPU overclock)
