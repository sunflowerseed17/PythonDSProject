FSLY earnings are coming up on Feb 12, I decided to take my position now as I feel the overall market trend for risk stocks is bullish.

Why am I placing this bet?

1. I think FSLY is undervalued per its revenue multiple. Yes, they are losing money, but if they tighten the reigns a bit and get closer to profitability I believe the market will react positively.

2. The introduced some products with synergy to AI - such as semantic caching, which can help customers reduce cost and speed up performance of AI apps. If traction is good, should help the stock.

3. There are a few technical gaps to fill - one to the $13 level and another to the $20 level.

4. Options are relatively cheap… a positive surprise can really create some asymmetric return IMO - considering we were alert at $12+ levels before the Fed fiasco.

I took a few legs with ranging from “reasonable” to “lotto” expiring Feb 21.
