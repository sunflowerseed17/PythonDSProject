I'm newer to the game, played about 10 games in 2020 and then never played again until earlier this year. I convinced a friend to play and that's who I've been queuing with and we both aren't terrific. I would love some advice before I jump into ranked as I'm about to hit level 30. My duo plays jungle and I've been floating around trying to find a role, but most commonly I play mid or top.
