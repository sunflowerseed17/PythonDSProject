AV was full of Nightslayer brainrot players that hated their lives and hated to play the game even more and would get so mad about any AV game that lasted over 6 minutes and it lead to epic trolling and drama in chat, But now it appears they have quit the game or moved on to other endeavors they can just buy gold to win at. RIP randy marsh saga of drunk dads attending their children's baseball game just to fight other dads 1/16/25-1/20/25 AV. I will miss you.
