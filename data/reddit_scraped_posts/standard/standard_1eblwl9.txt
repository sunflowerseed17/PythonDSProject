I've been adding to my collection and using Picard to tag. It's been a while and this is a new computer, so a new set up.  
I am sure that the last time I used Picard (about 3 years ago) I could use a setting which allowed additional folder information to 'pass through' or get saved to the destination folder, and the entry - the folder containing the album - in the original folder be completely deleted.  
Are these functions still available or how do I set them up again?
