Honestly, kind of confused these days who to pull for, who's worth it. As a f2p account, I just want to get the best out of it. I fell in love with Zhongli and Hutao but Hutao's gameplay has been kind of getting boring to me and I need some fresh wind. Any advice on how to determine who to pull for and who is not "worth it"?
