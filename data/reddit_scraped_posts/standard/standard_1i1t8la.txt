Madainn mhath a charaidean!

I came across this video https://youtu.be/50jkO2s4Sp0?si=l9T1Dx5e4SX9my3a of a guy speaking English but using German Grammar.

I struggle with grammar and some of the concepts, like 'I have Gaelic upon me' which I remember from classes I did 10 years ago. Thought it might be interesting to see English with Gaelic grammar, and it might help understand the framing of Gaelic better.

Any thoughts and opinions?

MÃ²ran taing!
