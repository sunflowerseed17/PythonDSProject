I get completely why people don’t like the movie. It has its flaws. The obnoxious cat marketing had people expecting the worst from go. The script definitely could’ve used another run. It got too convoluted for its own good and especially with the unnecessary last minute shared universe connections that feel stuck in 2019 cinema.

But what this movie does have that so many big movies lack nowadays is clear directorial style and aesthetic. It know what it’s going for in that way early on and never lets up. I was impressed that the dynamic between Elly and Sam Worthington’s character as well as between her and the Argylle Henry Cavill vision and Henry Cavill and John Cena have good chemistry.

Overall I like the movie whenever I watch it, and I think more people will feel this way the longer we get from its initial release and people disappointed it wasn’t another masterpiece like X Men First Class, Kingsman or Kick Ass.
