Hi! I need clips to illustrate good and bad interviewing techniques (specifically semi-structured interviews to gather information) for a talk. I found some awesome examples from Spotlight, BUT the subject matter (priest pedophilia) make them a poor match for a work talk. 

Does anyone know of movies (or otherwise) that have similar scenes?
