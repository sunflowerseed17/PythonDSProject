With constant balance changes and being perma ban in pro for what feels like over 10 years, it’s insane she has never once had any major changes to fix this outside of just nerfs. zeri had the exact same problem(instead of a dash its MS) i feel like if she was made by August, she would have by now. They need to actually fix the core issues of why she’s so good in pro (oppressive early game, pro skewed ult that no one, even the kalista player, likes) i think they need to give her serious changes to take her out of pro play because seeing kalista at permanent viability like ksante and no major changes for 11 years is bizarre.
