Does anyone here remember any particularly tricky/well-hidden chest in the region? Any tip that could save me the trouble of going through an eight-hour video for the sake of a single chest would be highly appreciated! I have all achievements, my aranara book is all completed, I have all furniture blueprints and I have spammed the compass a whole lot, though I can’t say for sure I haven’t missed any trackable chest :’)
