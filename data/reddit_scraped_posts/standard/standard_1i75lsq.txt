From gameplay perspective, this is the only change I would like to see, no matter it’s an armor passive, booster or just overhaul. For example, you can carry two EATs when you call it, you can carry both MG and Commando on the move. That will open up so many support weapon combinations just within the current list. I often find myself lack of choices when I want to use medium pen support weapons but team needs AT. Or I bring EAT but only get to use 3 at max when starting a fight, and wait for call-in time. At the end, I just use recoilless rifles to be safe or count on teammates. 
Personally, I often bring a sentry to cover my lack of chaff clearing or AT in bad situations. However, I would rather switch to a second support weapon that is already on my back and deal with different enemy types instead of running and waiting for call-in to switch.
