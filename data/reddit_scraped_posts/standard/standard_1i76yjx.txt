More of a 'rebuild' than a build as the PC is almost complete save the PSU and hard drive:

Trying to restore an old PC to use as a spare and it's missing the PSU, I found a few on ebay.co.uk and amazon.co.uk under Â£20 but when I asked on the discord server, it sounded like they were more bombs than PSUs..

Can anyone help me find one that's not twice that price please?

Bonus points if anyone can recommend a decently sized cheap SSD!
