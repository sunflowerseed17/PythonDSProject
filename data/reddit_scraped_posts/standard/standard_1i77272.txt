Games like Fallout and Skyrim stay popular because players can create huge amounts of new content with mods. I was excited when Baldur's Gate 3 added mod support, but most mods only change small things.

I haven't seen any mods that add new quests, areas to explore, or new characters. Is this impossible to do in BG3, or did Larian limit what modders can create? 

I hope Larian will make it easier for players to create more significant mods in the future.
