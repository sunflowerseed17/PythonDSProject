Iâ€™m thinking of installing the PAX system so it looks built-in. I have identified the preferred configuration  which is 118 1/8 in wide but the wall is only 117 3/4 in. Is there a problem if I try to gain a half an inch by cutting out drywall? If not I will lose efficiency by having to go with a smaller width configuration and use MDF to close out the built-in look. 


Any additional tips from those who have done it?
