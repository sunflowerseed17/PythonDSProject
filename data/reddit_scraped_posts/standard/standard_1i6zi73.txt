Like a movie that feels like it was made by a bunch of friends having fun with a budget. Something like Matt Stone and Trey Parkers movies or a Youtube skit made on a budget. I'm curious cause i've played games and seen animations with that sort of feeling and feel that they always have a charm to them cause no ones stirring the pot with executive nonsense
