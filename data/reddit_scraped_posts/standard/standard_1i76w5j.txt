ive been maining dva since 2016-2017, been playing ow for 9 years, never quit it. overwatch means a lot to me, kept me busy as a kid when i didn't have anyone to hang out with. dvas always been my favourite, i cried so many times at her cinematic when it came out and still cry when i hear her "ill see you at the finish line" voiceline in-game ðŸ˜­ sorry for the long caption, im kinda sappy now, but i hope i did her justice. photographer is alrlostsomewhere on ig!
