Hello everyone!

So in Steam there's this menu where a key can be entered to redeem a game.

Every once in a while, when I feel super bored, I try my luck there hoping to get a AAAAA game. Of course this never works. ðŸ˜‚

So I was wondering: Has anyone here ever successfully guessed a Steam key? Either by randomly trying or by making a typo while redeeming a game and getting a different game than expected. If so, which game did you get?

I'm also interested to learn about the technique behind it. Why is it impossible to guess a key?
