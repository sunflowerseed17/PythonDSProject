Just hit 29 in a classic era pve na server as alliance and never got in after cueing. What’s going on? I remember being able to find servers with short cues in 2020. I wanna pvp a bit but if the battle grounds arnt working ig I gotta reroll ? Thank you I’m a bit newbie. Do I need to switch to anniversary realms? It’s all a bit confusing
