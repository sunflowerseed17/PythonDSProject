What movie was the first one to have a  at drink milk? Recently saw this in the garfield movie and just wondered where it started since i think i’ve heard it’s started in movies too. I also wonder why somebody put that into a movie since it’s not true at all and milk is actually bad for them (they are lactose intolerant). Thanks in advance!
