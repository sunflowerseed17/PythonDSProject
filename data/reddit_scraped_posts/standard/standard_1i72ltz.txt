I’m going to preface this with — I have no idea where to put this and this could be the absolute wrong place BUT they are movies.

Okay so idk why I started this and yet I did - terrible BUT ORIGINAL plot summaries of movies

And you are all of my victims but I think they’re funny so here I am. At least I enjoy it.

I’m really curious who can get them all - there’s only a few and I’m sure many of you can

Anywhooo

Here we go

“Harry Potter tries to kill Miss Congeniality and Magic Mike comes to the rescue”

“Stiffler and Josh support McLovin in his quest to ditch Goldslick vodka for the whispering eye”

“Erin Brockovich thinks she looks nothing like Erin Brockovich”

“Ace Ventura gets in a fight with a hedgehog”

“Michael Corleone bets everything on Wanda”
