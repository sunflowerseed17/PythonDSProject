Hi folks, Legion 5 17ach6h, was working absolutely fine last night, get home and plug in, power light comes on for a few seconds then goes out.
No sounds of fans, boot up or anything.
Tried the disconnect from power brick, press power button for 60 seconds and reconnect. Exactly the same. 
Any ideas? I can't begin to explain how having my laptop working is absolutely essential for my work and need a very quick fix. It can't wait 2-4 weeks for repairs.
It's a personal laptop.
UK/Glasgow if anyone has any suggestions for a repair shop.
