Saw a post earlier of people wanting certain delisted games. I have been seriously PC gaming for almost a year now so I missed out on a lot games. Just curious what I missed. 

Edit: 

I forgot to mention the ones I have. Nothing crazy awesome though. 

LOTR: War of the North 

Project Cars 2 

Spec Ops: The Line 

Transformers: Fall of Cybertron

Dirt 4

Sonic Generations (2011)
