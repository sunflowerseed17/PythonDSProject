Per this article among others: https://www.npr.org/2025/01/10/nx-s1-5252757/california-wildfires-dei-diversity-influencers-firefighters

It seems some have blamed DEI hiring practices and democratic government removing fire hydrants/downsizing the police among other things for the fires. Are the people claiming these things completely wrong, spot on, or somewhere in between? It also seems like Gavin Newsom has earned a considerable amount of ire, to what degree are he and his policies responsible for this if at all?

I’ve also seen folks on social media claiming homeless people started the fires by shorting out electric heaters in their tents. Is there any truth to any of this, or is it all just poppycock?
