Hello everyone!
Not sure if this theory was already formulated by someone or not.
But I always thought why zoro use the bandana when he gets serious? 
What if the bandana is a way to cover some horns that pops out of his head whenever he gets into battle frenzy?
And if this happens is because one of his swords or just his bloodline?
As we know the dad of zoro got killed by a pirate, many people speculate on mihawk which have a design of “vampire” what if he is a ctually a demon killer and killed the dad of zoro for this reason?
