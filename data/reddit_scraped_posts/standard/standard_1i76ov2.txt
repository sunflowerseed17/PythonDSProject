So around a year ago i bought a pre built this one exactly [https://radiumpcs.com.au/products/omen-lvl-4-r5600-rx7600](https://radiumpcs.com.au/products/omen-lvl-4-r5600-rx7600)

but I am trying to play games like rust and vr games but it either doesn't run or is insanely laggy I also cant run a YouTube video smoothly at the same time (I have adhd)

so I'm asking you guys what I should upgrade and what I should upgrade it too

thx
