Hi there,

I'm looking at getting a Tab 11 Pro Gen 2 with keyboard and pen bundle to help with work. I've been searching online retailers but having a nightmare time trying to find it. A lot of retailers aren't putting up correct specs. I've seen dozens that claim to be the Gen 2, and many not claiming to be Gen 2 but maybe are but reading descriptions doesn't clear things up.  Even the UK Amazon listing is unclear. They are offering a Tab 11 pro bundle on the same page as what looks to be the Pro gen 2 as a standalone tablet. Is there a definitive product code to look for for this bundle or a recommendation for a retailer that isn't going to price gouge?

Cheers!
