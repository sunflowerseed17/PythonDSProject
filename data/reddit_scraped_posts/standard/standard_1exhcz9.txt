Seeing that kernel wealth is a fairly new company - what are the main risks associated with investing with them for an extended period, 5-10 years. 

Are people investing 10K+ at a time with them currently for extended periods. Just wanted to know what others think before investing in a fairly new financial institute. If that is something you take into considerstion.
