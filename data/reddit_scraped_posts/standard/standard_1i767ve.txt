Hi everyone,

I’m in a tough spot and need some advice. I live in a 1950s apartment where the building controls the temperature, and the heat from the old vents is minimal. It’s freezing in here, and I’m struggling to stay warm.

I bought a small heater from CVS, but it blew a fuse almost immediately. The apartment only has three fuses: one for the living room and bedroom (on the same fuse), one for the kitchen, and one for the bathroom. I tried plugging the heater into the kitchen outlet, but it doesn’t heat much space.

I’m considering running an extension cord from the bathroom outlet to power a heater in the bedroom since the bathroom has its own fuse. I’d also like to run a better heater into the kitchen. However, I’m not sure what type of extension cord is safe to use with a space heater. I know they draw a lot of power, and I don’t want to risk a fire or other safety issues.

I’m looking for recommendations on two things:
	1.	The safest type of extension cord for a space heater.
	2.	A reliable and efficient space heater that can warm up a 400 sq. ft. room without constantly blowing fuses.

I’m desperate for a solution—it’s unbearably cold. Any advice or suggestions would mean so much to me. Thank you!
