I 18y M have been living at my great aunts on and off for around a year due to family problems at home I would come to stay with her for the weekends and sometimes for a week or two. When I was younger she also took care of me almost more than my own parents. In September of last year I started talking to a girl who is now my girlfriend. I should preface that this is my first relationship. On top of this I didn't know but her mom knew my mom and got her fired from her job. This caused some bad blood between our family's that I had no clue about when we started dating. Anyways early on I could tell that she didn't like her and the point got even more exasperated when she overheard me talking to my now girlfriend about some absolutely disgusting things that happened with her ex boyfriend. My aunt thought she was a liar and started saying she'll believe her once she saw the police report. Which I think is way too far and none of her business. Now fast forward to today. during this time she has met my girlfriend and I had thought that she changed her mind. But then she brings up the fact that she doesn't think I should be with her. I asked why and she couldn't give me a concrete answer. So I kind of snapped and told her I don't really care what she thinks about her because it's not her relationship. On top of other things it evolved into a yelling match. I'm staying with her for the next couple of days but after I am going home and never allowed back here. Am I the asshole for sticking up for my girlfriend and myself?
