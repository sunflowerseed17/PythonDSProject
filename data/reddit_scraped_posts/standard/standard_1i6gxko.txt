I've never played Silent Hill 2, and as I want to go through as many great story telling games from my backlog in this year, which is the better experience in 2025, OG or remake of SH2? On howlongtobeat is states the base playthrough in a remake is twice as long as OG, is there an extra content that might make the game stretch unnecessarily long as compared to OG? Does OG game look too dated nowadays? Tell me what you recommend.
