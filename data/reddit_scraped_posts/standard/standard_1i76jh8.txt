Before anything, I think it is important to note that I am from a very conservative country. Premarital sex is a huge no-no and even just sleeping over at your partner's place when you are not married is frowned upon. You also usually live with your parents until you're married (unless you are able to afford to live elsewhere). This leads me to my friend's offer.

My friend Sarah and I have known each other for a little over 10 years. We pretty much treat each other like family. When I told her I had gotten into a relationship, she was so happy for me. She said if I ever wanted to spend the night at his place, I could use her as an excuse when telling my folks where I'd be for the night. 

A few days ago, I decided to take her up on her offer. I asked if it would be okay if I told my parents I was sleeping over at her house even though I was really planning to stay with my boyfriend for a night. She told me she feels like I'm using her and feels uncomfortable about the fact that she might have to talk to my family about the whole excuse. (My family rarely talks to my friends.) I honestly didn't expect this reaction from her. I feel like the AH for making her feel this way. 

We talked about it and I told her I understood and apologized because I felt I prioritized spending time with my boyfriend over our friendship. 

However, after having a few days to think about it, I realized I never would have asked her about it in the first place if she didn't offer to help me.

AITA?
