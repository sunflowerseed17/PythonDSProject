Hi guys, I have a quick question for you. I am looking to upgrade my PC and mainly futureproof it. I have Ryzen 3600X and RTX3080 10GB and I would like to uprade CPU. I am gaming on 4K.

The issue however is that my motherboard has AM4 socket and quite frankly I dont want to buy another MB RAM AND also CPU.   
  
So I just wanted to know if Ryzen 7 5700X3D is a good idea since its the last AM4 high end cpu from AMD. Will it last me for the next \~7 years? Or is it just better to buy all new socket? I would like to upgrade my GPU in the next few years to RTX 60xx or 70xx.

Thanks
