Title: I have multiple game OSTs in my library, is there any way to play through more than one or am I limited to only listening to one soundtrack at a time?

I have both Hollow Knight - Official Soundtrack and Hollow Knight - Gods & Nightmares. I'd like to listen to both without having to manually pick between them. Is there any way to do so?
