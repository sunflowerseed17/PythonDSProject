Iâ€™m at the point of my life where I am not interested in keeping up with the kids anymore BUT theyâ€™re doing something weird lmao 

My husband and I go to a bar each Friday to have a few drinks and play pool. Itâ€™s very much a dive bar, and up until a few months ago, the crowd was very much old white guys, but luckily in a comfortable way. 

The last few weeks I have noticed a huge influx of young people. Barely 21 young - totally fine, they have just as much of a right as anyone to be there. 

I just donâ€™t understand why theyâ€™re bringing in armfuls of beanie babies and taking pictures of them on pool tables and bar tables? Again, thereâ€™s nothing wrong with this, but I feel like Iâ€™m missing something here ðŸ˜… 

This is the closest thing I can find on Google but is not exactly whatâ€™s happening: https://www.google.com/search?q=beanie+babies+at+a+bar&sca_esv=8ab9ccf1dff7da3b&rlz=1CDGOYI_enUS1038US1038&hl=en-US&udm=2&biw=430&bih=745&sxsrf=ADLYWILdgxMy7KLnXsk6Gp1cBdP5kJe4LQ%3A1737264535689&ei=l42MZ6fkKby40PEPxfbE4AU&oq=beanie+babies+at+a+bar&gs_lp=EhJtb2JpbGUtZ3dzLXdpei1pbWciFmJlYW5pZSBiYWJpZXMgYXQgYSBiYXIyBRAhGKsCMggQABiABBiiBDIIEAAYgAQYogRI2jVQ1AZY-itwAHgAkAEBmAGVAaABqheqAQQ5LjE5uAEDyAEA-AEBmAIOoAK0CsICCBAAGKIEGIkFwgIEECMYJ8ICBRAAGIAEwgIIEAAYgAQYsQPCAgQQABgemAMAiAYBkgcDOC42oAfDaQ&sclient=mobile-gws-wiz-img#vhid=_SNFMNkKcMUQ3M&vssid=mosaic
