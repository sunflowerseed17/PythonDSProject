Lewis Hamilton has officially started his time with Ferrari, first Black driver in Scuderia Ferrari’s history. And probably one of a handful black employees in team history. 

It took one of the exceptional drivers in the history of F1 to break the barrier but it’s a hell of a first step.

The sport is still dominated by White Europeans (even white Americans get dismissed). 

I hope Lewis’ story continues to open doors for more drivers of all backgrounds that way we get to see the best talent at the wheel and more fans support the sport.
