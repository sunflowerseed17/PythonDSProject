What's the best way for me to accommodate running three showers in my house at the same time?  

I use the upstairs shower.  The water heater runs to my shower first.  I usually have (almost) enough hot water, but my water volume drops so much that it's hard for me to engage the diverter to even get the flow from the tub spigot to the shower head.  And once I have the diverter engaged, the flow is pretty low.

I'd love it if I could just replace my hot water heater (perhaps with a somewhat larger one) and fix the problem, but my preliminary research suggests that it won't address the issue unless there is a problem with my plumbing or water heater already.  I think everything is working correctly; we're just overtaxing the system.

My pressure is already pretty high -- when we're not using three showers, that is.  If I add a pump to my system, will that create more problems, or might a higher capacity water heater + shower pump fix my issue without overtaxing my plumbing?
