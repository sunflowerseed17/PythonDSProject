I (36M) got engaged to my fiancée (37F). We had been planning to get engaged before my mother passed away, and our engagement was something we had discussed for months. Unfortunately, my mother passed away two months before, and we’ve been dealing with the grief and loss as best as we can. We decided to postpone our engagement plans.

In my culture, we typically observe a mourning period of 40 days after the death of a close family member. This is a time for reflection, mourning, and paying respects. The mourning period just ended and a month later we got engaged , and I went ahead with the engagement that we had originally planned.

My fiancée and I are happy and excited about our future together, and I don’t feel that I should delay something that was important to both of us. However, my sister is angry with me. She thinks I should have waited longer. My dad is wasnt upset and said my mother would not have wanted me to wait.

I understand their concern, but I feel like I’m just living my life and honoring my mother in my own way. My fiancée has been a great support during this tough time, and we both feel this is the right decision for us.

So, AITA for getting engaged just two months after my mom passed away?
