Hey r/wallstreetbets,

I guess last post got deleted because video attached was similar to another post… the video was of Trump announcing the $500 billion Stargate AI venture led by Oracle, OpenAI, and SoftBank.

With that announcement there’s a lot of speculation about which tech giants will benefit the most. Notably, Oracle (which is up 7% today)  and Microsoft are at the helm of this initiative. Given Intel’s deep relationships with both these tech giants, I’m thinking Intel is positioned to be a significant winner in this scenario.

Intel has a longstanding partnership with Oracle, providing advanced processors for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, enhancing the performance and efficiency of AI applications. This relationship could see further deepening with the heavy AI focus of the Stargate initiative.

Moreover, Intel recently made a major 15 billion $ chip deal with Microsoft to manufacture chips, potentially adding another layer to their involvement in the Stargate venture. Microsoft’s interest in using Intel’s foundry services could mean a boost for Intel, especially if their manufacturing capabilities are utilized for any new AI chips or technologies developed through Stargate mean more demand for Intel foundry. 

Considering these factors, it seems like Intel might not just be a participant but a crucial player in making Stargate a success. Do you think Intel’s existing collaborations with Oracle and Microsoft give it an edge in this massive AI project? Could this be a turning point for Intel, especially with their ongoing efforts to expand their foundry business  ? Do you have an opposite hypothesis that this is bad for Intel and why?

Would love to hear your thoughts on this!

Incoming insults without rational as to why this is wrong will be ignored.
