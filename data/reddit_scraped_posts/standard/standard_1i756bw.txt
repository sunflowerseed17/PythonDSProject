by Larian's decision not only not to make any DLCs for BG3 but also not to make any sequel to the game?

Now, of course, it's absolutely their right not to do so and I am sure there are reasons to which we are not privy that made them go this way. But...

...If any game proves that a developer is perfect for the job, it's Larian. If they had started work on BG3 DLCs or even BG4 immediately after launching BG3 two years ago, we might expect the nex product in 2026 or even the end of 2025.

I know that Larian are working on not one but two new franchises - THAT IT OWNS - but neither of them are going to be BG3+ or BG4 are they? And I bet that any other studio that WoC rent the IP to are not going to make a game *like* BG3. To me, this is all a matter for sadness though, of course, there's nothing we can do.
