She told me a long time ago that she gets STD tests regularly and that she has been getting them even after us being official.

I asked her why, since she supposedly only had sex with one person before me, and has only had sex with me since we started dating.

She finally disclosed her reason and left me confused.

Her older sister has AIDS and lives with her. So does her boyfriend.

They're both medicated and can't spread the virus while they are on their prescriptions, but doctors recommended the whole family should get regular tests.

Apparently the two other siblings are unaware of this, and so is her other sister's partner.

Even if medication prevents contagion, I don't think it's 100% safe, otherwise they wouldn't ask the family to have regular tests.

We've been having sex with no condoms lately, and although I know she's healthy, I don't think I would've taken the risk knowing she has possibilities of aquiring the virus daily.

She also shares the bedroom with said sister, and her parents never let us sleep in her bed, I wonder if it's somehow related.

I'm not knowledgeable on the subject but I felt a mix of betrayal, disgust, and pity for her.

I don't know how to handle this to be honest.

TL;DR: My girlfriend lives with an AIDS patient and has disclosed it today, after 8 months of dating.


Edit: For those stating she doesn't have AIDS, I was told she nearly died from the virus as it was at an advanced stage; she even started balding and had problems walking. If that doesn't correspond with AIDS, I'm sorry.
