Hello! I posted a week or so back asking for help with a bathroom renovation. People suggested I replace the walls around my tub before gluing up a new tub surround. Before I do that, I wanted to see if anyone here has any idea what type of drywall this might be?

Looking on Reddit/past posts, some people suggested plaster over rock lathe? House was built in early 1970s. The material is tough, drywall knife got nothing on it. It’s relatively easy(ish) to drill into- but cutting into it is a different story, tried both a drywall knife and an oscillating tool with a circular attachment and it was impossible to get through- it may have dulled my tools if anything.

I’d like to get as much info as I can on it before I proceed with removal/decide on next steps. TIA!
