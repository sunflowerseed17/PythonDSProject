So I was watching the orochimaru vs sarutobi fight in naruto and sarutobi uses the attack fire dragon bomb and ends up calling it as karyudon.

And I was confused when I heard it because I knew king used the fire dragon emperorattack and he also called it karyudon.

So what exactly is the translation of karyudon because in naruto it means fire dragon bomb and in one piece it is interpreted as fire dragon emperor
