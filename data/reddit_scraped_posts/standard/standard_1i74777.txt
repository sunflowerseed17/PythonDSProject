I know theirs some really smart animals that do get bored but I'll see just a random spider sitting in its web all day. Do they just blank out untill thrir next meal or mate comes? Or are they just sitting there mindlessly without a thought.

I know this is a hard answer because we cant physically ask them but i figured with our brainwave technology we woukd be able to figure it out. "Just like how elephants have the same reaction to us as we do to puppys. They think were cute!"

I put bored in quotations because i know bored isnt the right answer for other creatures as they also have no perception of the feeling. Just like how fish dont feel pain but they can feel uncomfortable or a pressure from a hook/knife and know that it isnt a good feeling.
