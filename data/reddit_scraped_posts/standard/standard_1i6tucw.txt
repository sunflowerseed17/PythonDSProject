Bought hundreds of calls when PM started to crash over rumors of the Biden admin wanting to crack down on tobacco. Sold half with these remaining. 

I think I will hold through earnings and believe they will crush with guidance knowing the FDA authorized ZYN productions and an increased price target by Morgan Stanley.
