I’m especially very curious how is Genshin running on the new Macbook pro 14” M4… I was basically playing on iPhone 14 pro all the time, and now I plan to upgrade my old macbook laptop to a new one because i need a better machine for many reasons, and of course this new macbook pro M4 i’m planning to buy, is a laptop where also genshin could actually run quite nicely, so I’m just curious if anybody has played on it ?? 

I’m also very curious how the game is running on other macbooks (Pro and Air) especially M3 and M3 pro, but share your experience if u use any mac/macbook please. 

I’m probably already decided to go with the Macbook Pro 14” M4, 16GB, 512GB/1TB but still i might change my mind and go with something different who knows..

E: i plan to use that Nvidia GeForce NOW thing, I read that you you can play Genshin on Macbook using the GeForce NOW.. 
 - does anybody have any experience with that??? or if not than how do you play Genshin on yoor Macbook?
