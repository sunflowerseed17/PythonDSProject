I have a basement hopper window with a rotted wood frame. I need to replace it, but i don't know how. The purple highlight is the area with the rotted wood (picture 2). The red highlight is rotted wood that is behind metal trim (picture 3). The green highlight is the wood I have not checked but am pretty sure is also rotted (picture 4). Picture 5 is all the color coded highlights together. The wood is rotted because the previous home owners had it covered with soil from a garden bed. I plan to remove the wood when it gets warmer out. Is it just as easy taking out the hopper and replacing the wood, or is there more to it? Please help!
