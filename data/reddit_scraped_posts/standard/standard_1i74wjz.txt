I’m not going to lie, I was skeptical of them covering a whole division, but it’s brilliant in that they are guaranteed 1 playoff team. They got very lucky with 2 going to the playoffs and 1 contending for it to the last game of the season. Love it and would love them to do it again with another division. Maybe the NFC east? Also, I did a quick search and didn’t see a subreddit specifically for Hard Knocks. Given they have been expanding it, would people be interested in one and to be mods for it?
