Right now, they have a 15W-27L record, good for outside the play-in. They have lost 7 games in a row, and are 2-8 in their last 10.

The signing of Paul George was supposedly the step for the franchise into championship contention. But, we are seeing the opposite of that right now.

Injuries on their key players, as well as on their star rookie McCain, hampered their championship aspirations this season. 

Should they just tank and hope for a good position in the draft next season, or should they still strive to compete for a title?
