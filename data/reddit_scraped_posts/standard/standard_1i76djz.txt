Ik this has been a talked about concept. But having a squad or so of SEAF drop in would be unique. Have a squad of 10 or so 2 with either the stalwart or machine gun, 1 with a recoiless rifle and the rest with liberators. It would pretty neat and would help with  fire superiority and crowd control in messy situations. Could also help in solo runs and provide some support in doing tougher side objectives when you are split up from your fire team.
