There was a move in special $500 deductible only. Nothing serious now, I’m just playing in my head but I’ve been considering moving out of state quietly not even telling my family just need to restart and build something for myself. I paid the deductible. The apartment is immaculate and I’d leave it nice and move in ready …. But if I bounced and didn’t pay that $3000 is there a database? They can sue? Anyone ever done this?
