Design my small bedroom

Hello!

I just moved to a one bedroom apartment. The bedroom is 3,20m wide and 2,25m long (approximately 10 feet 6 inches wide and 7 feet 5 inches long for americans).

In the picture, the "big door" at the top wall represents the door/window to my balcony and it doesnt open that much, its just for visual representation.

I really have a hard time figuring out how to design this bedroom (I have a partner), If i should go with double bed or queen size bed for example. I also would love to fit a floor mirror and clothes rack, while also keeping an "spacious design".

Any ideas would help me very much in how to design/decorate this bedroom.
