ik the title is dramatic but guys, if this new vault isn’t proof that the game is losing profits and the devs are scrambling for money, idk what does. 

so upsetting, bc instead of making changes for the good of the player base and the game itself, they’re letting it naturally die & take everything they can get before it does.
