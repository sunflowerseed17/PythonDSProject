Boney can turn into Nika herself of course kind of involuntarily and she can't fully control it yet. Transformations are based widely on situation she's in but that is what make her power astounding. Her awakening could mean being able to transform consciously into any future befits her in respective situation, meaning she could become Luffy/Nika as king of pirate(because it's viable future now, not even narratively but in reality Luffy feats and how fast he grew into power makes him the best candidate). Even as Zoro as king of swordsmen or Chopper who would know cure to every disease in the world, not to mention his probable Zoan awakening. Possibilities are limitless and akin to Luffy only her imagination is a barrier and in that example its Luffy who is "limited" by transforming only his body and environment from and into rubbery things and shapes while Boney can become whatever she would want to. I remind you that's not her awakening when she transformed into Nika. It's her base ability to transform into other people's awakenings. Then again, it's mind blowing what she could do with awakening of toshi toshi no mi.
