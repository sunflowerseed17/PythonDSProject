Hear me out. And this may not be a spoiler, but I wanted to tag it anyway just in case. So, if you do the High Harper quest where you rescue Minsc, Jaheira will tell you to start out at the Thieves Guild and she’ll want to come with you to talk to Nine-Fingers, the Guildmaster. Talking to Nine-Fingers, she has this attitude that I’m not even sure I know how to describe. Condescending, smart-mouthed. You get it.

Later (or even before you rescue Minsc - order doesn’t matter), you can go to Jaheira’s house and talk to all her kids. The oldest is Rion, and she and Jord, the half-orc, confront their “Mother” as soon as she steps foot in the house. Let me tell you. Rion has the same smart mouth attitude as Nine-Fingers. 

There’s a note you can find in a basement that hints at Jaheira’s house being under guild protection. Jaheira calls her by her first name, Astele, if you take her to the guildhall with you, and even Astele admits they have “crossed paths” over the years. 

I dunno, but I am willing to defend it. Anyone else notice this or have these thoughts?
