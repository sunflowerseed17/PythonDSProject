So i've been leveling a melee only hunter on hardcore wow (wing clip triggering weapon on hit effects is the appeal as we hit end game but thats still a long way away!) and i've reached my first conundrum I am level 30 and i can dual-wield Wingblade+Outlaw Sabre or use Strike of the hydra.  
I know the consensus with warriors in leveling is 2-hnd weapons are better until you can get hit gear, would it be safe to assume it works the same for me?  
Curious what your thoughts are.
