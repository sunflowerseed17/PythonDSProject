I searched through some old posts in this sub but they are all at least a couple of months old, people were mostly defending Lively and there was no mention of Reynolds, but apparently things took a turn? And now there's a lawsuit ? Honestly I heard bits about it a while back but never took an interest, but now I've been getting like [10 minute tik toks](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMkxPyqmS/) about it, def curious but not spending that time with this lol anybody care to clarify from the beginning ?
