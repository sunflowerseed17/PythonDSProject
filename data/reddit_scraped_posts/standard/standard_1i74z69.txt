I have a Ryzen 5 5600X with a 3060 and 16gb of ram at 3200mhz. So i suppose the question is will i be ok? i dont want it to TANK my fps but ideally id like to stay away from low settings too if i can bc this game just looks so good. Saw the steam requirements and it said a ryzen 7 and a 2060 and this is a first for me seeing requirements this high tbh. 

TLDR: I wanna liberate everything but i also wanna see.
