Hi all, I’m driving from Luxembourg city to Le harve France (Normandy) and wondering is it better to travel through France directly or take the Belgium route. Is there a noticeable difference in the toll roads E highway roads opposed to the A highway . Wondering if anyone has taken a similar trip and know the better route to take. Can I assume the number of gas stations on the way would be the same? I’m just looking for the better road to drive don’t mind the toll. Thanks for the input.
