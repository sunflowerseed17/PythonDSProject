I started playing league around 2020. I’ve always found Azir interesting with his abilities being really fun to use. I’ve tried him a few times over the years but he’s always felt like the reward for learning him isn’t worth the time and effort compared to other champions. I’ve heard he is kept purposely weak due to being incredibly oppressive in pro-play when he feels good in casual. What about him made him so strong in the past and what changes would you make (if at all) to make him feel rewarding to learn for the casual player?
