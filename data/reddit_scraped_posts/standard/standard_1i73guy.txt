I remember everyone talking abt him no longer piercing through shields, not so long ago i tried playing overwatch again and today i found myself loving ramattra(i wasnt a big fan of him gameplay wise before so thats cool, he was my fav lore wise so thats sick)but i tested andâ€¦he pierces? Or was the changes for the 6v6 or sth?
