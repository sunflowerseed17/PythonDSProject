I take care of a couple feral cats.. I bought a plastic shed for them and put insulated cat houses inside that have a heated pad in them. With the frigid temps I'm wondering if this is enough for them.

The shed has cat doors cut into it but I have to keep the flaps up or the cats wont go inside. So the inside of the shed is freezing cold, but it does block the wind which helps. Their houses inside the shed are insulated and have the heating pad but I can't close the flap on that house either.

I've been doing a lot of thinking about how I can improve this for them. I bought a ceramic heater, but they were afraid of it due to the noise. I then bought an electric oil filled radiator style and they were ok with that but it really didn't improve the temperature of the shed. I haven't tried an infrared yet, but I guess that would be the next thing to try.

I was wondering if anyone has any ideas on how I can heat the shed. Also, should I insulate the shed? Would that even be useful considering the cat doors are open. I thought about running some spray foam insulation along the bottom of the walls at least as I do feel a good amount of cold air coming from the bottom. 

Or, is having the houses with the heating pad enough for them.

Thank you for any help.
