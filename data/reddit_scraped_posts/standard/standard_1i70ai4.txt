Hi. I (27F)am getting married a few weeks from now. My bff (26F) was supposedly be my Maid of Honor on my wedding day. But instead of helping me out in the preparations, she just gave me more problems and stress. Every bridesmaids was able to buy their own dresses weeks before the wedding but she still doesn’t have hers. Gave her my preference in what kind of dress I would like to have for the bridesmaids and even gave links to the dresses that’s okay with me but doesn’t consider it. Keeps on giving me different colors of dresses even I specifically provided her the color that I want. Asked for the OTD Coordinator then proceeds with she’s shy and doesn’t want to converse with her. I provided that there would be a van provided but insisted that she will uber instead. There still alot but won’t go into details. This really gave me a lot of stress because supposedly she should be helping me. Am I wrong to remove her from my wedding?
