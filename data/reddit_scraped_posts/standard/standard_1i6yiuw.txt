Played with friends on the game's release and looking to play again, here s some issues ive had and here to ask if those aspects have been improved

-the weird difficulty curve, i remember clearing through the first tower after a few hours, not rolling through it but we won, then after triple the original time the second one hit us like a wall, not only that but as soon as you started winning a few pal bosses you could start steamrolling every other ones

-the awful emptiness of the map, after a little time the map becomes awfully empty other than the tower and meaningless eggs 

-is there more endgame content now?

-what about the various bugs due to it being in early access and the overall performance ?

Aside from this what some recommended settings to make it as enjoyable as possible? Especially concerning the exp, i dont want to have to do meaningless exp farm, maybe ressources but not exp

Apreciate any answer
