Title: Cheated on my wife years ago with a woman who was our friend. Her husband just died and she's reached out to both of us. AITA for feeling a little yucky when texting her back? I genuinely feel sorry for her and her kids, I'm just ashamed of how I went behind my wife's back a long time ago...

It's like I do care about the family; I'm just not interested in cheating, or even getting too connected. I do feel somewhat uncomfortable texting with her over the few messages we've sent back and forth. And I'm showing them all to my wife as well. I really don't want to be rude; they played a part in our family's lives. And I also realize it's not my place to be some hero to swoop in and give support. I'm not trying to be anything but empathetic, yet still I feel kinda odd texting her.
p.s. I was almost always answering her texts, or after I didn't answer, it's been about a day since she's sent anything back.
