I am getting married soon.

My partner wanted to do a proper elopement and I wanted to do the big wedding. We worked through this difference and came to an agreement about how the day will look

1. Private first look
2. Small ceremony with immediate family only
3. Cocktail hour with extended family (some of which are coming from overseas)
4. Reception with everyone (friends and family)

I am getting some blowback from my family about the ceremony. This is immediate family only, so parents, siblings and grandparents. Then the private cocktail hour is a moment for extended family to congratulate us. We are putting this on as some of them will be travelling a long way (thousands of KM's) to come to the wedding.

My family has issues with this part of the day. They say that its insulting to the overseas family, it is not worth their money and effort to come here and that it may cause a rift between myself and my mother. My friends have also expressed a dislike of not being able to go to the ceremony.

On the other hand, I have worked through this with my partner and come to this compromise. Is it wrong to go into a marriage and instantly disregarding my partners wishes?

AITA? WIBTA if I just said no one can go to the ceremony and we will elope instead?
