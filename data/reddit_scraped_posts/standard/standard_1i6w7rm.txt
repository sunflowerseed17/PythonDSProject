In the latest cold snap, it's very obvious that there's an area around our kitchen window which must have little or no insulation in the wall for some reason.   The window itself is newer (2019) and there are no gaps around it, but when I hold my hand up to the wall area next to it, between the window and the cabinets, I can just feel the cold flowing off of that wall.   Of course it makes the countertops cold, which then makes the kitchen feel colder.    I have to wonder if possibly this area didn't get insulated properly, or there's a gap at the top in the attic insulation, allowing attic air to flow down into and out of the wall.   Unfortunately it's an area of the attic that we can't get to, far from the access opening, and way under the eaves.

Is there any product like a spray foam insulation where I could drill a small hole through the drywall near the top (or in several places) and pump it full of some sort of expanding foam?    This is a bigger job than just using something like "great stuff" crack filler, and that stuff is a mess to deal with anyway.   But I'm open to suggestions.    It would be no problem to patch and repaint the openings.

Thanks for any ideas.
