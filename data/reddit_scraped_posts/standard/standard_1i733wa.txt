I was given a free countertop that is 30 inches deep and already has plywood glued to it. I want to install it on a cabinet that is 24 inches deep so I need to cut it down to size (25.5 inches deep).

How should I cut through both quartz countertop and the plywood? Or should i cut the plywood from the bottom with a circular saw set to the right depth and then use an angle grinder with a diamond blade on top?

Please let me know, thank you!
