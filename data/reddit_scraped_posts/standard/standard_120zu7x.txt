Does anyone have any experience with a 1.6l diesel Superb? I haven't owned a car for years, but will do shortly and I'm pretty set on a Superb Estate for many different reasons. Ideally I'd prefer the 2.0 TDI, but they are rare within my preferred price range of around Â£5k unless well into 100,000 miles. Does the 1.6l diesel engine have enough pull for a car of this size? How reliable are they generally as the mileage gets higher? Any experience I have is that a bigger engine is always better. I will be driving around Scotland, so lots of different road types if that helps.
