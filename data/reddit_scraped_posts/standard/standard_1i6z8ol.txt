Do players that actually troll, running down mid and other stuff, get banned?

I noticed that in Emerald elo, there are a good amount of these people.

Reporting them, i never got Report Feedback, only when someones goes afk or way too toxic.

If the answer is no, why is it harder to punish these kinds of players that grief?
