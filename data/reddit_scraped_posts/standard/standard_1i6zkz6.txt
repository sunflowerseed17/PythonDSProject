I thought I could dig this area out enough to do an outdoor shower deck that just drains into the gravel/earth. Soil soaks up things quite easy after a good rain here. But I donâ€™t think these footings that support this staircase are deep enough and may not do well with lots of water draining around them constantly. Am I over thinking it? Or should I abandon this location? Thanks in advance!
