I have never studied art (science background) but I have tried taking an interest in some of the master pieces that have received acclaim over the years. 

I really like the world of classical art right up to probably the era of Monet, but I can't exactly make sense of most of the works that came after his time. They became a bit too "surreal" for me, if that is a term that I can use?

  
Some examples include:-

* Dali - A lot of his works appear "cool" but none of his works seem to evoke any emotions inside of me despite me staring at them for 15-20 minutes (including his actual works displayed at galleries)
* Mondrian's works also look quite cool to me but I don't exactly feel blown away while looking at his works
* Some of the contemporary works that I have seen at galleries in the last decade or so have made no sense to me at all. They just seem like arbitrary strokes/colours. While they once again, look quite cool, I don't think I have ever been able to associate any kind of a sophisticated feeling with these art works. I feel like I am missing out on something.

The realization -  think I connect better with the classical art works and I do feel various emotions while looking at them - probably because they seem way more relatable to me and they do tell some kind of a story

How would you approach appreciating contemporary art? What kind of things are you looking out for? Is my expectation of feeling any emotions unjustified ? Am I approaching modern/contemporary art incorrectly?
