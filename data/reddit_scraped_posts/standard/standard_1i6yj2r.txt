I'm trying to download/archive some long videos and I'm looking for a way to download these videos that isn't yt-dlp.

yt-dlp doesn't work for me. I don't know why as I've followed every up-to-date guide to the letter and I've given up on trying.

Does anyone know of a Youtube to mp4 and mp3 converter that supports high quality downloads of long videos?
