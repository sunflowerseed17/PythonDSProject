Our Daily Question Megathread is for those questions you don’t feel warrant making their own post, such as:

* Can my PC run WoW: Classic?
* When does my class unlock a certain ability?
* Which dungeons are worth doing while levelling?
* Feel free to ask anything related to WoW: Classic!

Ask the unanswered questions you’ve never gotten around to asking.

You can also ask these questions over on our [Discord server!](https://www.discord.gg/classicwow)
