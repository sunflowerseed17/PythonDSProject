I rolled alliance last month with dad amounts of playtime and went through getting regularly ganked in Redridge to now incessantly camped in Duskwood and STV.  There were moments of joy when me and a few others caught out a rogue and killed him (one kill in return for probably 20+ ganks), or when we had backup lvl 60 allies come in and guard us. Fun fun but umm literally the last 8 days I’ve gained 2 levels from 26-28. The “pvp” (ganking madness and ensuing events) are pretty fun if not mind meltingly frustrating. But I don’t know if I have time to get to max level. 

Does anyone have regrets from rolling PvE? I have ONLY played pvp/rppvp servers in my tenure and I cannot fathom the idea of seeing a horde player as a non attackable entity, it would be so strange. But also…. Things have changed now and I have no time. I want to do dungeons and raid etc.
