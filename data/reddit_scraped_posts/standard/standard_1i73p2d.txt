Hey guys I’m a mid laner who enjoys the game.

I was wondering if u guys can help me choose my next champion.

Till now, I’ve been practicing one champion at a time to learn and try and master each one of them.
My criterion of picking a champion is to think about the role each champion provides to the team, and I want to widen this “role”.

Here’s my list
Ahri: favorite champ, utility mage
Akali: assassin
Vladimir: late scale 1v9 dude
Yone: only viable ad mid
Syndra: great burst mage

So I don’t know what other “role” there is, but I want to add one or two more champions, just because I want to.

Last note, here are the champs I simply don’t want to touch playing mid lane:
Galio, Irelia, Orianna, Katarina, Ekko, Talon, Zed
Don’t ask me why.
