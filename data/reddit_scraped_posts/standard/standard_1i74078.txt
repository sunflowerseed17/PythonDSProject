My wife has a cousin who is special needs. He has FASD and will likely need counselling, tutoring, special ed teacher. There’s a good chance he may go into foster care at some point and he’s 10 years old. My wife says she would want to take him in. We already have 2 very young children. One under 5 and the other is not even 1 year old. My wife already struggles with them as it’s tough dealing with 2 young kids. I don’t see how we can pour so much time and resources into another child and take care of our own kids. We put our kids in swimming, ballet, soccer. We also both have very demanding jobs. 

She’s upset that I told her we really can’t take in another child especially one with special needs. I get she wants to help but I feel like it would be the detriment of our own kids and probably our relationship. I just don’t see how it would work. We are also adamant about not having any more kids ourselves. We are barely making things work now and our relationship isn’t even in the best place. 

If we are balancing work, extracurricular activities, time with our kids, our relationship, how can we invest time in a child that will likely need so much help. Financial resources aren’t the issue it’s the time and energy involved. 

AITA for saying no?
