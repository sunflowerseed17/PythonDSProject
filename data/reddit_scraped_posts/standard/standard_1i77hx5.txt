Long story cut short, this guy I had been seeing suddenly cut everything off when we started to get serious and he was constantly "sick" but not quite sick. When we broke up it was on terrible terms and i basically proceeded to ruin his life. About 1 week after we broke up i fell terribly ill and my skin turned yellow. Before i knew it i had very serious mono which lead me to complete insanity so bad that I slandered his name online publicly several times. Im only 17 I cannot wrack my brain over this anymore. 

I understand now that things could have been better but am i the asshole for having this reaction? It has been 3 months now and this has completely deformed my entire self being.
