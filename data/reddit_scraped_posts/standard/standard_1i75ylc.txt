I know there is a iron farm that uses villagers and zombies to generate iron golems to kill them and farm iron but I just dont feel comfortable trapping villagers close with zombies. I know Im soft. Also, I tend to set my difficulty to peaceful by default because I dont want a creeper to blow up my build
