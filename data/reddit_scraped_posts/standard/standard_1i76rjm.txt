Hi everyone, I'm here to explain my problem, I can't play League of Legends in full screen because the monitor fries and goes black, when I play in windowed mode the game goes smoothly and I can play it. I think it's a resolution problem, I tried changing both the game resolution and the PC resolution but nothing, if you have any advice they are welcome, thanks in advance
