We just moved into our new home (from the 70s). The previous owners DIYed some improvements with overall great taste but there's a couple of questionable spots. The biggest one is this bathtub.

There's this hole in both ends, the gap between the bathtub and door frame, plus a wooden trim piece at the bottom of the tub that is not even flush with it so water will obviously spill and get trapped. I was thinking about removing the wood and switch it with a round PVC quarter trim that will be glued and siliconed to the bathtub, but let me know if anyone has better ideas. I have no clue on how to fix the holes tho, please suggestions!
