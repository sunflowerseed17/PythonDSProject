I didn't know I was a leecher...

I have now lost count of the amount of guides on port forwarding I have read. I still can't share my folders. Still have the 'ports closed' despite going through endless guides on how to set up my tp-link ax50. I've created virtual servers, I've done the port triggering. I followed the guides on [portforward.com](http://portforward.com), [https://www.pcwintech.com/port-forwarding-guides](https://www.pcwintech.com/port-forwarding-guides) (even though it was last updated in 2021 and doesn't have my router) I've checked my windows firewall is allowing connections - it claims it is. I've set a static ip for my computer.  
What on earth am I missing to allow me to share my 600gb+ of flac and 320kbps mp3s???
