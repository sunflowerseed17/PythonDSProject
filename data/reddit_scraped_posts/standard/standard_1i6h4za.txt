The first map shows the state of the group immediately after the demobilization of the AUC in 2006. At that time, there were over 30 "BACRIM" (mafia-style criminal organizations that emerged from the AUC).

The second map shows their presence in 2016, when the FARC still existed (though they were on the verge of demobilization). It's noticeable how their presence is more scattered across territories controlled by the FARC or areas close to them.

The final map, from 2024, reveals how much ground they’ve gained following the FARC's demobilization and how quickly they have expanded into the Eastern Plains region.
