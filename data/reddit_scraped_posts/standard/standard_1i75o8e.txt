Title: While doing an operation on Vernen Wells we came across some bot facilities seemingly built around human prefab buildings. Never seen this before.

These pictures are across two different missions in the same operation. I've been through probably about 75 bot missions, and the last few nights have been doing missions on Vernen Wells. First time I've ever seen this type of map gen, let alone in two different missions. I thought it was pretty neat. Makes it feels like the bots took over a human encampment and built around it.
