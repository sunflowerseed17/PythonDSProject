I have an issue with my Laptop (Acer Predator PH315-54) and my External monitor (Gigabyte G34WQC A) where FPS drops through display port 1.4 or HDMI between 30fps to 50fps and display get stuck/lag during game play.

I am getting 144fps when I use my laptop screen or another external Monitor, example an Asus monitor VG24VQ.

Some things I have done:

\-          I used different cables (Mini Display port and HDMI)

\-          I connected a different laptop to my Gigabyte Monitor and it provided from 120 fps to 144 fps.

\-          I connected my PC in another monitor using same cables and I was able to get normal FPS.

\-          I uninstalled my laptop drivers and reinstalled them with no changes.  
NVIDIA Cleanup Tool (CleanupTool.exe) from link [https://developer.nvidia.com/cleanup-tool](https://developer.nvidia.com/cleanup-tool)

Above test were done with Fortnite and Marvel Rivals.

So it has to be something in my Laptop with this Gigabyte monitor that is causing the problems and I haven't been able to get it fix.

I’m looking for any ideas on how to fix it.

Thanks!
