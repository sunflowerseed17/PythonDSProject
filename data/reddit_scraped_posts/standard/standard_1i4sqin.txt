I havent had a chance to watch anything lately, don't have much time to "investigate". But i've heard that there was a lot of drama at the current FIDE tournament.  
I've read a tiny bit about Magnus and jeans but i've heard there was a lot more drama.  
There is also someone being accused of cheating(not Hans, someone else)?  
And some other drama with Nakamura? 

And im particularly curious about shared title thing. Why did they do it?
