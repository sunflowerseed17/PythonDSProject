Just watching Keanu in Johnny Mnemonic and there are quite a few parallels between it and the Matrix. Don't want to post any spoilers on the plot etc.
Also some fun casting choices; Henry Rollins, Ice Tea and the girl who played Dizzy Flores from Starship Troopers. 
Anyway it's a bit of a fun retro look at a dystopian future.
