First of all, I know it's now called lidar in-game, but I am used to the old name.


So, I played Squids yesterday and, even though I did quite a few missions on that front, it was only yesterday when it occured to me that I haven't seen a radar station on any of them.


Does radar side-objective not spawn on Squids? If so, why is that? I know that there are shitloads of PoIs in the cities and most of them don't contain anything interesting, but there's still plenty of regular emptiness where normal PoIs can spawn.
