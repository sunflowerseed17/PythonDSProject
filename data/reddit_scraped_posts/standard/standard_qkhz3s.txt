Hi all...

New gigabit customer and so far happy with the service. Joined the referral program which said I needed to use my email for referrals.  
Contacted CS who confirmed this. I had seen previous posts where people were using referral code but CS said this was not available. I'm loathe to give out personal email address so will have to create a specific Hyperoptic email account which is a pain as I have a few emails for different purposes.  
If u/hyperotpiccs is reading this can you please look at changing to a code instead of giving out personal details?
