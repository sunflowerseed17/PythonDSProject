I follow on insta and they made a vague post about leaving a couple days ago. Its deleted now. 

Today I saw another one about how theyre leaving all social media for awhile.

Im confused because idk what caused the first post and the comments on the new one are quite mixed if this is related to people being mean on the internet vs upset about tiktok going down and not making money?
