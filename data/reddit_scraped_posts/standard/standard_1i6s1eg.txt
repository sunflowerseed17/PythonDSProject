Previous post: I ordered shoes online from Under Armour official website. They sent them with the security device still attached... I went through troubl of cutting the device off. They don't fit my child. I get to send them back now (for second time) without the security device. 
Never buying this kid shows online again.

Also, the shoe dropped the toilet paper. Also, I'm not posting more pictures of the store (er, my house) this time.
