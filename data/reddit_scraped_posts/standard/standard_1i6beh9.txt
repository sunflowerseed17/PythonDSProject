Since TikTok came back, my feed has been flooded with people talking about how the app going dark was all for show and that TikTok is tied to Meta now as part of a deal Trump orchestrated. Is this just a conspiracy theory and my algorithm keeps feeding me variations on it because I watched one video? Or is this something a significant amount of people are legitimately concerned about?
