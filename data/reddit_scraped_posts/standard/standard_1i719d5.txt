I have every setting at low, running 2k with vsync double buffering at 60fps

game runs at 30fps, takes long times to load, when it does load textures are unrendered and objects missing/polygonal. fixes itself after a long long time but not when actually playing things are always unloaded

have slow hdd mode on too, running on directx11

any suggestions on how to fix?
