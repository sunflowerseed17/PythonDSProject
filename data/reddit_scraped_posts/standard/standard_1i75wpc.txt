I've recently moved my homelab out of the prebuilt pc into a custom built one, but nothing happens when I plug it in or press the power button. I tried seemingly everything and I'm worried it might be the motherboard, since I ordered it from another country and it could take a while to replace it.  
I tried the paperclip test, which worked, so I assume it's not the psu.

I didn't use the pcie power cable, because my GPU doesn't require one afaik.

Components

* CPU: Ryzen 7 5700x
* Motherboard: Asrock x570 Pro4
* RAM: 2 16gb Unknown, Unbuffered ecc 2666MHz from the prebuilt
* RAM: 2 Kingston KSM26ED8/16HD, Unbuffered ecc 2666MHz
* GPU: Nvidia Quadro P2000
* PSU: be quiet! Pure Power 12 M (650 W)
* Storage: 2 WD Red HDDs, 2 Crucial MX500 SSDs and 1 unknown nvme ssd from the prebuilt

I tried these things:

* Try 2 different CPUs of the same model
* Only use 1 Ram stick
* I unplugged the power cable for the motherboard and for the cpu and plugged them back in
* Try without a GPU
* Jump the power button pins
* (Maybe) Reset the cmos

But none of these things worked.  
Is there something I missed or that I should try?  
A broken Motherboard would be the worst, since it would take a ages to replace and I have a lot of thing on my homelab that I use on a daily basis.
