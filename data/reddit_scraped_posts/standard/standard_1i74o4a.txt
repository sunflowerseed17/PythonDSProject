I bought a xbox to play palworld with my xbox friends, the Playstation handles my spotty wifi alott better though. So out of curiosity since the xbox was acting up I entered the multi-player world code in my Playstation not thinking it would work but it did.  I loaded in, found my base and was able to join the guild. Game crashes more for host on my Playstation unfortunately.

My question is; is crossplay a thing now or is it a glitch or something?
