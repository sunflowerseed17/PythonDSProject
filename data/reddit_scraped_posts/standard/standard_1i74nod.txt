This happened yesterday. First real time playing WoW. 

See some mage gear upgrades in rfk. Party up, but after like 30mins part is disbanded cause we can't find a tank (10+ warriors messaged)

Okay, whatever, time to do some questing instead. Go to the harpy cave in thousand needles, get to the quest area, but can't handle all the mobs solo. A group comes in, but doesn't want to invite me (I also couldn't figure out how to talk normally after being in party chat. /local didn't work, I could only figure out /yell).

Not a big deal, but I try to leave the cave. Too many harpies are after me, I have to turn around and run away. I manage to kill one harpy and polymoph the other, but low hp and mana. I try to use evocation then mana shield while the harpy is sheeped. The warrior from the other party has had enough though, and hits the harpy. I manage to yell thx while my entrails are being eviscerated. 

Is this the wow experience I have to look forward to? I realise now I could have ice barrier'd, cold snap, ice barrier'd to truly bm. I had good interactions on the weekend, but I'm still rattled. Hopefully someone finds this funny
