A year or two back, there was a lot of buzz about Scotland and the SNP party wanting independence because the UK Supreme Court said they couldn’t hold their own referendum…but then nothing more seemed to happen. Did the SNP just give up? 

Wasn’t there supposed to be another referendum regardless of the court ruling? https://www.snp.org/nicola-sturgeons-full-statement-announcing-the-2023-independence-referendum/
