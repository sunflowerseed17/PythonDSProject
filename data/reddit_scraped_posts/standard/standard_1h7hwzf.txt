Maybe a little late, but a thought popped in to my head while reading through this sub.
During the coronation ceremony in Edinburgh Mr Saxe-Coburgh-Gotha-Battenburg did not have the Scottish Crown placed on his head according to reports Isaw at the time. I recall great fuss made about how the English Crown had to be resized to fit him. 
It was my understanding that to become King of Scots the crown must be worn.
Can anyone clarify this for me, and if true, does it infer he is not King of Scots? #NotMyKingAnyway
