I have a busy schedule working a full time job with mandatory OT as well as taking care of my pets and being a single person who does all the house stuff alone.
My best friend has a situation where he decides his complete own schedule. He does college online at his own pace and works less that 5 hours a week with uber. Recently he has been getting mad at me for not making time to hangout with him. The thing is I specifically request he picks a time to hang out but he refuses to schedule a time with me. He just texts me out of the blue asking me to hangout and gets upset when I say I’m doing X rn I can hang in a few hours. He says I’m being unfair and not prioritizing him by “requiring him to schedule appointments just to hang.” Am I the asshole?
