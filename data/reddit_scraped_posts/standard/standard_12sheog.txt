Question to the community do you think justicur chestpate and legs will hold there value since its from TOB or is TOB farmed crazily . I know everyone will say bandos over it but wondering does justicur help tank in slayer for some tasks to reduce prayer pots ? Wondering if anyone does this . Personally I think it looks cool and would like to use some modern gear over proslyte.
