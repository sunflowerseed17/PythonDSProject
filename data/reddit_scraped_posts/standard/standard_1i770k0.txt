Hi Trailblazers!

⭐🚂 Welcome to the Daily Questions Megathread! Feel free to ask any general questions about Honkai: Star Rail that don't necessarily require their own dedicated posts.

**New:** Try out the HSR Databank bot for assistance in answering your own or other Trailblazer's questions! [See details in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HonkaiStarRail/comments/1ed2il8/introducing_uhsrdatabank_an_easily_summonable/). 

Any questions that can be answered rather quickly (i.e. anything that can be adequately addressed without any discussion or can be given definitive answers) can be asked in the thread below.

\>>> Example: Can my phone run this game?

If your question has discussion potential, please create a separate post, and include the “discussion” flair.

\>>> Example: What do you think of March 7th’s combat efficiency? Here's my opinion…

Before making new discussion posts, please be sure to consider if your question could be better suited to this thread!

When both asking questions and sharing answers, be concise and detailed so other players can understand. Please maintain a stellar and respectful attitude toward others, and don't forget to share your appreciation to fellow trailblazers for helping you out!
