I'm trying to download Gta 5 from dodi repacks, I tried earlier with fitgirl. The torrenting part took 6 hours, Ik it's slow but my internet like that. Unpacking the fitgirl repack was just entirely slow and some files were damaged so then I had to switch to Dodi.
It was pretty quick till like 96% but after that it has taken "6" hours to reach 98%.... Is this normal? How do I fix this?
