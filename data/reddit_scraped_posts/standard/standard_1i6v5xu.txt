Can anyone name a movie with no happy ending? Where the bad guys win and the good guy is either killed or doesn’t save everyone in time? I feel like a movie like that doesn’t exist, but I could be wrong. 

Even when it’s a trilogy or more, the last movie of a series always has a “happy ending”.. there’s always a positive resolution. Has no one ever made a movie more realistic to life where the good guy doesn’t always win..

Edit: I guess I was dead wrong lol, thanks for all the answers. I don’t really count horror movies for obvious reasons, but all the other ones def qualify - Se7en, No Country.. and mostly independent movies.
