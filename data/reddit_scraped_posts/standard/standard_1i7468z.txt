so i allready have 30 pity on chronicle and i want to pull for baizhu or shenhe and i m not sure who. i don t have many cryo dps but i think that if the next nation is snezhnaya (not sure if i wrote right) shenhe will be meta. baizhu would help me a lot in my cyno or maybe some other teams. i don t think i can get both (i only buy welking). who should i pull for?
