Hear me out.

I don't mind if GTA 6 is $100 as long as other games stay at 60. GTA is a generation defining game with thousands of hours of playability per user. It can charge twice of what other games cost and GTA 6 would still be a good deal.

My problem is why are we gamers and other companies assuming that a if a game like GTA raises it's price all other games can? Why the fuck do copy paste COD and FIFA have to cost the same 70 as a generation defining game?

I know rockstar is a rich company and I do not need to glaze them like this but to put things in prospective for you, candycrush, yes candy fucking crush makes same money as GTA 5 does. Rockstar is putting out a game that will be a new standard for a whole generation of games, it will innovate new mechanics and systems for the gaming industry. They can charge higher but istg if these FIFAs start costing more I'll get real mad.
