i've been trying to get both shenhe and xiao for a really long time but (unless I get peak luck) i dont think i'll be able to get both of them

i really want shenhe so that she can make my ayaka deal a genshillion damage and I've had her main weapon for a long time + good artifacts and her materials ready

but I also have really wanted xiao for a long time because he's just cool and is the character that i've been trying to get the longest, but shenhe might not get another rerun for super long because eternal cryo prison

who should i fate point track in case I lose a 50/50? i doubt ill be able to get more then 2 five stars this banner
