so i live in louisiana, it’s currently cold asf and it’s snowing as hell for the first time (7 inches) me and my mom decided to drive around our neighborhood after we got the heads up that it was safe to do it, and i saw my friends walking and i tried to roll down the window and yell to them so hopefully i could hang out w them, and my mom told me no bcuz it was freezing and i got mad cuz i was 100% sure that i could handle walking by myself, im 14 years old and it felt like she was babying me, i got mad, we started arguing, and she proceeded to tell me that “if we never went on that ride, then i would have never even thought about hanging out with my friends in the first place” and yeah i get her argument but at the same time i feel like i should be able to do what i want with my friends and im kinda more aggravated because she won’t allow them
to come today, am i in the wrong?
