I believe our democratic space station is being wasted despite its potential. While it is true that the Helldivers remain frozen until they enter battle, the lore is at the service of the player to enjoy it, and not to limit us. On our ships, in addition to the personnel, there can be up to 4 Helldivers planning the strategy, selecting the armor and weapons and even selecting the planet and the mission. There is a component of patriotic and brotherly camaraderie that should be exploited. Why not use the space station to socialize and organize groups with like-minded people? People who speak our language, or fight for our favorite enemy faction, or whatever. Why not allow the creation of alliances? There could be alliance stratagems that are funded by members' resources, rental stratagems, optional custom cape for members... What do you think?
