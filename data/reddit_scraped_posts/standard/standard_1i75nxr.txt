That’s it, that’s the post. I would love to personally operate the SES Guardian of the Galaxy so when I come answering SOS beacons, they know they’re getting an idiot. However due to "of the Galaxy" not being a second name option, I am currently operating the SES Founding Father of Family Values. 

Either that or let us name ships ourselves.
