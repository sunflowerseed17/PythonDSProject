Are there any breed exclusive pals? I tried searching but only find posts that talk about breeding in general, or are pre-Feybreak and still don't really answer my question.

And I know the game mentions somewhere that there are pals you can only find in dungeons, but I was wondering if there was a list or way to see them. Thanks!
