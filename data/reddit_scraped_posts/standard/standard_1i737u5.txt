Sedgwick had all my information ready to proceed with the claim. I told them nothing happened during my rental and that I had photos from pick up and drop off and they said “Okay, we have canceled the claim” 
They didn’t even ask to see the pictures. I’m thankful I’m overly anxious and took pictures but damn what a waste of my time and energy
