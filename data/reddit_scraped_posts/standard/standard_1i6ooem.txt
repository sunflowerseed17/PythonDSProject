The front of my house has sunk just over 2" starting halfway down it's length (old and newer construction point). I am thinking about jacking it up in the crawl space to get it level and I have built a LOT of this house myself so I mostly know what I am doing but had some questions.   
  
When you are jacking up a house, what happens to sill plates that are attached to foundations? Do the walls just lift off of them?

I am getting ready to install siding and the 2" would be noticeable under the large windows. But I guess I could match the siding TO the windows so they are both out of level but visually matching. Do you think the 2" worth the effort to lift?
