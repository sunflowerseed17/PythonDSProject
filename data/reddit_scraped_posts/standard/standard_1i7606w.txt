Hey

So with a group of 4 we wanted to play something on Steam and quickly realized when 4 people have 100 games, it takes a long time to go one by one over them and see if everyone has them.

So instead, I coded a simple app.

Input your steamid (or sign in with steam) - select friends from the list --> view all common games

It's not monetized. I just thought other people may use it. Please share your feedbacks!
