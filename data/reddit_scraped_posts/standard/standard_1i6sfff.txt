Everyone has had their moments from Anchorman or Airplane where they can't stop laughing, but let's hear the more subtle moments.

For example, in the largely forgotten and disliked Stiller/Jack Black movie, Envy, my dad and I found ourselves cry laughing at [Christopher Walken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiH6iQYCVXM) around 1:46. One of those moments where you don't know why you're laughing, but we still quote it 20 years later.
