Been looking at Baofeng to dip my toes in the water. Many, many years ago I used to have a Midland CB radio in my car but CB was dying and there were hardly any users.
Watched a few Ringway Manchester videos on YouTube and they recently recommended the UV 5RM.
Live in Glasgow, so want to be able to listen in to aircraft and marine channels - Ferry operations etc. ISS would be a bonus.
Don't understand much of the technical aspects, but want to learn, so any recommendations on where to learn the basics would be good too.
Any suggestions? 5RM or something else?
