I've just started as a civil servant working in UK. I'm down to 3 choices for a Union. PCS should be number 1 choice for my field, but I'm also considering Unison and Unite.  
Can anyone give me pro's and cons for all 3? Workmates are members of these Unions, no other Unions are represented in my office.
