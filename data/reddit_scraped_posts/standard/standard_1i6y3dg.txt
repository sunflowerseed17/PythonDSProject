In light of recent events, I’ve gotten the real urge to watch Nazis get the shit kicked out of ‘em. So far, I’ve watched Inglorious Bastards, Raiders of the Lost Arc, Indiana Jones: The Last Crusade, and The Rocketeer. Only other movies I could think of would be Dead Snow and The Keep. Any other suggestions, I would really appreciate it!!
