I hoped I at least understood about 3% of this game after grinding to 30 for so many hours and winning quite some unranked games with ease, but guess not lol. I know unranked games are not comparable to ranked at all, but getting put into the lowest rank with 0 LP and starting off with a 7 game losing streak (including losing all placement matches) is just brutal man haha. I'm objectively terrible I suppose but was hoping for at least one carry game. Haven't come across a game before that has such a high barrier to entry not gone lie (most games I at least start in bronze and get some W's at the start) or maybe I just started with rlly bad loser queue RNG no idea. Anyway I'm done ranting lol guess it can only go up from here :)
