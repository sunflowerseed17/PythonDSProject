Basically, what the title says but I've added some more details here. If I take a shower with just water (hot or cold doesn't make much of a difference, although hot definitely dries it out more). Let's say I don't use soap so that drying factor is out. Just the water alone leaves my skin feeling dull and dry if I don't use moisturizer. However, if I go outside and it's humid (which is essentially water, isn't it?) my skin feels great and moisturized. Why is that? Does it have to do with the water directly hitting my skin versus being absorbed in it slowly by humidity?
