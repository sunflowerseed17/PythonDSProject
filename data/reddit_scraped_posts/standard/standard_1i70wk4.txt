Hi, I know that we don't give a fck it's just normal draft, but since the start of the new season I've played several times against full stack teams that always have the same pattern, hard split pusher or tower destroyer champ, most of the time camping botlane, always invading lvl1 in fog clearly smurfing the game.

And after 10 games they doesn't use the account at all. I don't understand the point of doing this, in fact what do they get out of it, is it just to humiliate noobs or is it to sell the account afterwards ?
