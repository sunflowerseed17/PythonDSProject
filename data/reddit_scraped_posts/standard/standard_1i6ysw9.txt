So this portion of wall used to be a short wall with cabinets in the kitchen. I found this water bulge yesterday and cut it, then removed the dry wall today. I have narrowed the leak down to the shower in the bathroom right above here. In most DIY video, you remove the dry wall and there are the pipes. But since this is a weird leftover wall, there’s this wooden slab. Not sure if is supporting or was just needed there when the cabinets were there. 

Is removing this beam something I could do on my own? Or does it need to stay there?

And for narrowing down the leak- the home inspection noted a valve leaking in the shower, the sellers provided ‘proof’ of fixing it but I’m thinking it’s not all the way fixed or another valve started to leak. Is that fixed just by replacing the valve or do I need to take out the entire shower?
