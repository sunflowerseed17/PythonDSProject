I lost my job due to redundancy in November. While I have been looking for work recruitment has slowed down until the new year.

The big plus has been not having to go for works Christmas splurge, no secret Santa, no ridiculous jumpers that get worn once, no office decorations.

My former colleagues went for a night out very recently(we were all made redundant, small team) and I made the excuse that because I hadn't got a new job I couldn't afford to go. We all got decent redundancy, so they probably expected me to be flush enough to go out, but I paid off my car with it. That's far more use and value to me. There was enough left over that will keep me going until I get a new job.

It would have been even more shitty If I had just started a new job and had to go to that Christmas do as well.

This has been the first time in a while I haven't had to come up with excuses to avoid Christmas and its been a weight off my shoulders.
