So I (15F) recently broke up. Me and my boyfriend (47M) met here on Reddit. We've been together for about teo months but I was looking at his acount a few days ago and saw he had made a post looking for a girlfriend. I DMed him telling him I was breaking up with him. He called me stupid and then blocked me, but unblocked me only a few hours later. I messaged him the next day saying that I was sorry and I would get back with him. He kept telling me to leave him alone. Later he messaged me saying that he had 50 girlfriends, one was even a midget. My sisters (5F and 73F) both said I was the asshole. My mom (69M) said I was being rude and should give him his space, along with my neighbor's hamster (36M). So, AITA?
