Recently got a used IQAir HealthPro, a medical grade air purifier. This thing is an absolute beast and works like new. Problem it it’s old, and the plastic has yellowed. I’m thinking of putting peel and stick vinyl on this and cutting it to fit perfectly to make it white. Are there any potential issues with this or better ways to upgrade the look? 

I also considered using the Retrobright method developed to renew yellowed plastic on old computer consoles to its original color (this method involves using hydrogen peroxide, plastic wrap and sunlight), however due to the surface area on this purifier, it would be a lot of work to keep it wet/wrapped with no guarantee it wouldn’t yellow again down the road.
