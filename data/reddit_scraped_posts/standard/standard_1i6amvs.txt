I’ve been noticing a lot of talk recently about people deleting their accounts on Meta-owned platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, and I can’t help but wonder—what’s driving this sudden trend? Is it just a natural shift as people move toward other platforms, or is there something specific happening that’s pushing people away? Are there particular policies, changes to the platforms, or broader concerns about Meta as a company that have led to this growing movement? I’m genuinely curious because it feels like this isn’t just a random trend—it seems more like a collective response to something. I’d love to understand the bigger picture here.
