Earlier today I had some posts (like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1i3vp3w/unbelievable_were_actually_just_jokes/)) from /r/Silksong on my front page where they apparently have a meltdown over one of the developers changing their Twitter profile image to an image of a piece of cake.  
While I have played the original, I haven't kept up with Silksong news (or the lack thereof) at all, so this whole event is making no sense to me.
  
What exactly is going on that the developer using a cake image is making the community react as though he had personally salted their fields, burned down their house, and killed their firstborn?
