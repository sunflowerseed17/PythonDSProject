Hi! So Iâ€™m fairly new to this game and I just wanted to see if anyone on here can help me. Iâ€™ve been playing with the cotton candy lifeweaver skin and when I went to play tonight I realized I donâ€™t have it anymore. I also realized the lifeguard one for him and Kiriko missing as well and the strawberry one for Mei.ðŸ˜­ I have tried quitting the game and restarting and itâ€™s still not showing them. My game pass is currently active so that shouldnâ€™t be affecting it. The skins that Iâ€™ve collected through the battle pass are still there but itâ€™s those that are missing. Iâ€™m not sure if any more missing since those three characters are really the only ones I play as. Can anyone enlighten me on what the issue could be?
