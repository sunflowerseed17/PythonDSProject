Salute helldivers - im sure most of you have logged hundreds of hours on your super destroyer and have fought countless battles in the name of Democracy.  
  
At the same time, I'm sure alot of you have start to become a bit exhausted (and maybe even bored) of fighting the same three factions with the same gameplay over and over again (yes Arrowhead would sometimes buff or nerf certain weapons/strategmes but its still the same all in all).

Just throwing out an idea to the community (and hopefully the devs will read this too) - if it won't take up too much memory/resources in game NOR it would take alot of time to invent something new, wouldn't it be fun if you start to see factions invading each other, and you then send Helldivers (maybe even a squadron of 6) to clean up the mess? 

Since different factions require different loadouts, having two (or even three) types of factions to deal with requires MUCH more teamwork and strategy in your load out selections, making it a much more challenging and possibly fresh new experience for the current loyal helldivers that are still playing at level 150.

  
what do you guys think?
