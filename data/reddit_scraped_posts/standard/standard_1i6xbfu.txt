So, I'm not looking for any in depth strategy or meticulous information... But I'm reinstalling to play the new shorthand/fast mode a bit with a buddy who i used to play a lot with back in the day. 

I totally get the jungle and lots of stuff like that have changed since then- but I'd there are any words of wisdom that could be granted that would benefit an old Poppy top/ blitz/thresh support bottom main. It would be much appreciated.
