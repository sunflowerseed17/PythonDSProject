Edit: SOLVED! Fix posted at the end and in the comments,

During my fight with Gortash, things were going normal. I had all the extra enemies dead, he was down to 119 hp prone on the floor in a sleet storm, even had all his ghosts gone and had removed a curse on my MC for his legendary action.

Then I threw a hammer at him with Karlach and he stood up from prone and recast his ability Avatar of Tyranny. Which was weird. I threw another hammer and he, now standing, Cast it again. I spent the next 10-15 turns trying to break this loop and nothing worked. Every. Single. Interaction. Would cause him to recast this ability, granting him 150 Thp. I can't get higher than that. No combination I have can. Hitting, Pushing, Attacking, all trigger it. Additionally, Banishing didn't break the loop. Hold Person did take but as soon as he is hit, he breaks it and recasts.

As the ability is listed in the wiki as a reaction, I have a feeling something broke that allows him to use a reaction endlessly.

Anyway. This was my farthest run, and I hadn't done anything crazy. Completely vanilla, no mods, not a single exploitative reload, and this blows. I'm so close to those dice and this completely stopping me from getting them.

Any suggestions?

Update: Gortash is dead thanks to the suggestion pointed out by u/tiamatt44, push Gortash off the tower on the beach side killed him instantly. As for the other bugs surrounding fleeing combat, we'll have to see. But that suggestion that I missed on the wiki has fixed this combat for me. Many Thanks!

Also for the record, a fall of that height results in.....1506 bludgeoning Damage. That's a new personal best for sure lol
