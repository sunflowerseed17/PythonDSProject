So right now, I'm in the midst of breeding several end game pals like Bastigor, Selyne, Xenolord, etc. all of which have:

Legend
Musclehead
Serenity
Demon God

Can someone explain to me (as if I'm a dummy) how the elemental passives are specifically better? From what I understand, they give some sort of multiplicative bonus as opposed to an additive one, but what exactly does that mean?
