I almost always play competitive games like LOL, Dota 1, CS Go, Crossfire, PUBG, and any other niche competitive famous title that time ever since I was a kid. I was good at it and I really enjoy it. Now that I have a job and less time to play, I suck at these games now and I don't wanna put an extra effort learning new things at these games. Literal Wood Tier. It stresses me out even more, especially when losing at these games multiple times during my rest days.

My game right now is Genshin and Gacha Games is also draining especially when your luck is very bad.

Can you guys recommend me some games or tell me the games you play to chill or challenge yourselves into?

The games I played/finished are: Elden Ring Dark Souls 1-3 God Of War Doom 2016 - Eternal Skyrim (literal thousand hours, sneak archer slaps!) All COD .All Bioshock
