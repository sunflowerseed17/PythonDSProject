All I remember is that there was an actress who looked like a cross between Mila Kunis and the actress who plays Annie on community. She played a big sister or babysitter role whose name was Nora I think??? Could be wrong, I have googled a lot of Nora characters today and she hasn’t come up so now I’m less confident in that detail. She had her hair up in a messy bun for most of the movie and wore a V-neck +/- cardigan. I think it was an action, thriller, or horror movie. I can visualize the actress so clearly but I don’t remember where she’s from. Help!! 

Edit: Y’all are GENIUSES, it’s Lio Tipton! They played a babysitter named Jessica in Crazy, Stupid, Love and they were the main lead named Nora in Warm Bodies and my stupid brain combined the two movies!!! Thank you so much, that was an itch I just couldn’t scratch
