Basically im back from the game after 3 years and while im saving my wishes for good 5* supports im focusing on investing on the f2p ones and they said kachina is a good support but i dont understand her, explain to me what does she do, the artifacts and in what teams is she good
Also tell me if shes good with pre-sumeru characters because i have most of them and thats all i have
