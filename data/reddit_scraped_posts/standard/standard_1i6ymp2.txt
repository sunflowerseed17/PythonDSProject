Name: Towers D. Castle 

Origin: Castle was born to elderly parents, being their only son, he was heavily sheltered and protected. Although, they could never shelter him or his lust for adventure. At the young age of 17, Castle joined the Marines. After 2 years of diligent, albeit dissatisfactory, service, he obtained the position of captain, with an odd passion for cooking accompanying him. He would stay a captain for some time, whilst working as a Revolutionary Army mole. However, after multiple months of hard work for the revolutionaries, he was betrayed, sold out to the Navy to save another soldier who he never even knew the name of. He has been placed in Impel Down for accounts of treason and murder, although he has never killed pirates or soldiers, and is expected to die there.
