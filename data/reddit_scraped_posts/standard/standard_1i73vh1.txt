I dislike that you have to tryhard every moment in it even when you are significantly better than your opponent. This is because dying even once can be difference between you winning or losing the game.

I lose so many games where i start to not trying as hard because game is won already, so i die once. 5 mins later i find out that their team is even with the gold with our team, because i hadn't paid attention to how much ahead their top laner is in gold to our top laner.

 It is just hard to notice this, when you yourself are like 5k ahead to your opponent.
