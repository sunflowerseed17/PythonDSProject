When ever I see this topic come up it confuses me when people make comments stating the queen wore white to their wedding, when she didn’t it was a blessing ceremony they got married in the courts as they was divorced and couldn’t get married in the church and camilla wore white to that. 

Don’t get me wrong I like the narrative where it was revenge because camilla is seen wearing white to Charles first wedding.
