There’s a ton of answers about why we can’t get songs out of our head, and why a brain likes to play a song on repeat because of pattern matching. But - do we know what the trigger is for a song getting stuck in the first place?

For example, I haven’t watched Love Actually in probably 15 years. I haven’t thought about it in years either and certainly not very recently. I don’t know anyone who talks about it, I haven’t seen any posts about it on any social media platform. I haven’t watched anything with any of the actors from the movie recently. I also don’t celebrate Christmas so that’s not on my mind. AND YET for some reason today I thought of the Christmas song from that movie and there it goes looping around up there. Why did this happen?? Will I ever know??
