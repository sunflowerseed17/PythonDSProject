So a little back story-  my soon to be ex and I moved to Alabama for his job. He was laid off of his job the day my daughter was born, but is staying here to find another job. I am moving back to our home state to be closer to our family (taking daughter with). He keeps talking about how his family will finally be able to meet her and eventually (when I’m ready) they’ll have no problem taking her and watching her. The problem is, I don’t care to go around them. We were together for 6 years and they never reached out to me. Even when I was pregnant. When we lived at our home state together, they didn’t care to get to know me. So I don’t want to go back there and hang out with them while they get to know my son. I feel like it’s his responsibility to get together with his family, but since he’s staying here, he won’t get to do that. AITAH?
