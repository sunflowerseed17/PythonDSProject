I'm the only one who thinks Shanks lineage shouldn't have been revealed in FIlm Red? I think the reveal that not only Shank's father is a God Knight but also he has a brother would've been so much shocking had Oda not revealed anything in the manga

Just imagine the shock that the presence of Shank's twin in Elbaph would've generated had we not know he was related to Garling. I know we technically do know since 1095-1096 that Garling was in GV but that in no way would prove he was Garling's son so the reveal in 1134 would've been insanely more shocking.

Like, I find it very weird how Oda allowed such important information to be revealed in Film Red while he usually saves those reveals for the manga.
