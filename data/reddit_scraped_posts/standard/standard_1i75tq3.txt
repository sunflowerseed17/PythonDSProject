Right now I’m using RTX 3060 12GB and Bitfenix Whisper M 650w 80+ Gold. I’m planning to upgrade the GPU to 4070ti super. I heard that 40 series only support atx 3.0/3.1 PSU. Is it really mandatory or I could get away with using my PSU rn for a while? I checked using pcpartpicker and there are no problem but I just want to hear your opinion. Thanks!
