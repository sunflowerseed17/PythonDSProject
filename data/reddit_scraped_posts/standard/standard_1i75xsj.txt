I (M 26) have been with my gf (F 25) for four years. First two years went great, but eventually disagreements became more and more frequent. We went from never fighting to her getting on my case every day. Every fight is over something little like I’m five minutes late to call her, a restaurant gets her order wrong, my friends make an off color remark that even I admit is in bad taste. Most times she gets red faced mad then forgets and plays nice within 10 minutes. Things got really bad a year ago and I was really starting to get frustrated with our relationship. Then all of a sudden I got diagnosed with cancer. I went through surgery, chemotherapy, lost my hair, the whole deal. She was there for me every step and our little disagreements that turned into fights were a thing of the past. Over the past 3-4 months I have gotten good news from my doctors where I am considered in remission, my cancer becoming necrotic (dead) my hair growing back. But now that things have returned to normalcy, the fights have started to continue. It’s now back to every single day. I’ve tried to talk to her about it and she honestly believes she has never started a fight with me and that I am overreacting. I really am stuck because she was there for me at the lowest point in my life, but now she treats me poorly when I am back on my feet. I’ve talked about couples therapy and myself going to therapy alone and she shoots it down and belittles it. I feel my only course of action left is to leave here. I’d love any advice.
