Hiyo, so I'm having problems with my pc a pretty long time, when ever I'm playing games my pc "freezes" sort of what happens is that I can't use my keyboard or mouse, the only thing I could do with my mouse is move it and not click on anything, a bit later applications start crashing and all. Whenever I try to start my pc sometimes on just a random day everything begins super bad whenever I log in, the apps start crashing instantly and I can't use anything such as keyboard and mouse. If anyone has a clue with this I could need some help it's not that it happens every day but just random days every week or more. (If you need more information lemme know please)

These are my specs:

AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D
Asus ROG Strix X670E-F Gaming WiFi
Corsair CMK32GX5M2B6000Z30 16GBx2
AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT  16GB
