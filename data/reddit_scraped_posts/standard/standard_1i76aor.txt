I am a gamer and graphic designer, but I would also like to use the basics of Adobe Animate and Premier Pro occasionally.

Option 1:

Ryzen 7 5700

MSI B550 Gaming Gen3 Motherboard

RTX 3050 6GB

16GB RAM


Option 2:

Ryzen 5 5500

MSI B550 Gaming Gen3 Motherboard

ARC A580 8GB

16GB RAM


My question is whether I should go for the 6core or 8core processor. I'm on a budget, so is the 8core 16x threads worth it for gaming and design? If I can save money I would like to.

I also see the ARC is generally better than the RTX, but is the ARC I've chosen okay for Adobe software?


Thank you in advance :)
