My tub spout was leaking. I was pretty sure it was just a bad valve cartridge in one of the tub handles (we had had a similar problem a couple years back) and while I was pretty sure it was an easy fix, I didn't have the part handy and my wife (who was there the last time a plumber fixed the issue) had misunderstood the complexity of the job he did and had suggested the plumber had used a special tool to access a hard to reach area of the tub. 

The prior plumber (who charged $120 for the work last time) was no longer available, so I called a plumber that had been recommended. I let them know what we believed to be the problem, gave them the part number that was used to fix the problem last time, and waited.  The guy showed up, claimed the part was special order (despite the fact that a simple search showed that Home Depot just down the street had 8 in stock for $14 each) and then proceeded to quote me $970 for replacing it. (With a 2 day wait for the part to ship). 

Thankfully, I knew what the fix had cost before and had used the time to google videos of the replacement process (which uses common tools and takes roughly 5 minutes to do). Armed with this info, I confronted the guy on the pricing and he offered some bs about the cost being mostly about the warranty, and that it might take 1-3 hours of work because he has to be careful not to break the part when installing and that he might have to test it afterward. I told him he was a crook and to take his "consultation fee" and get out. 

I then drove to Home Depot and bought the part. 10 minutes after I got home it was installed and the tub was no longer leaking. I am convinced he saw someone who he assumed was totally clueless about home repair and just figured he'd take me for all he could. It's gotten really hard to find tradesmen in my area that aren't just looking to rip you off.
