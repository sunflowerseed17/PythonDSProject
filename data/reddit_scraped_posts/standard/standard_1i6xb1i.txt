Hello guys, i was scrolling my challenges when i see that there are 2 (dps threat and the one that requires to immobilize champs) where i am challenger, the first is #1 and the other like #60000. Does it mean that i am first and 60000 in EUW in that challenges respectively, or that iâ€™ve reached the last checkpoint? Idk thanks for helping
