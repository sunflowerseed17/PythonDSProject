Background info: I (F25) have been best friends with Sam (F25) and Lily (F26) since sophomore year of college and we roomed together for the latter three years. After graduation both Sam and I were able to move to the same city and decided to room together as that was much easier and economical rather than living in two separate apartments. Lily, however, moved to the other side of the country.

Sam and I planned a trip to go to San Diego as we lived rather close to the place and thought it would be a fun weekend trip. We also assumed that since we were roommates in our new city for a couple years it would be just the two of us and it would be much easier to plan. However when Lily found out about this trip, she got incredibly upset and shut down every time we tried talking to her. After this issue got out to our mutual friends, it was a split with some people taking our side and her side.

I feel very guilty about how upset she is and I don't want to lose her as a friend but it's also frustrating how she doesn't even try to see our side. AITA?
