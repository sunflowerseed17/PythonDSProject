Not sure this is the right place but... 

A long time ago I saw a comment on a post by a redditor from a repressive regime that went in to gteat detail about how Government ID is a bad idea, how governments use it to punish citizens and other horrifying consequences. I thought I had saved it. Sadly not.
Does anyone recall this post and can link it?
