Hello

As the title say, i am asking myself this question right now for personal reasons (that i don't want to discuss about) and i was wondering why most people would choose.
It can be an unreleased game but only if there is an official release date communicated.

For me it's Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 that is going to be released on the 4th of February, as i completely felt in love with the first game and a good way to immerse into another world and period of time for many hours.
