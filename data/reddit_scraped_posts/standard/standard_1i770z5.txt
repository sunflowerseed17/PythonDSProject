Hello r/soccer!

For those who are unaware...

Elon Musk, the owner of the social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) and a policy advisor to Donald Trump's new US government, was[ alleged to have performed](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/20/trump-elon-musk-salute) two fascist salutes at Trump's inauguration ceremony on Monday, 20 January. Following this, and his frequent bigoted comments, the debate has been re-opened about how online communities such as r/soccer should approach content posted on this platform.

Much football content - be it news stories, transfer rumours, or highlights - is hosted on the X/Twitter platform, and such it has been become a key facilitator of footballing discourse.

Recent months have seen several clubs and outlets move away from X/Twitter to platforms such as Bluesky, as part of a stance against Elon Musk, and the administration of the site.

We would like to ask the views of the r/soccer community, on how this matter should be addressed - with questions we would like to put to you including (but not limited to):

1. Do you think we should ban direct links to X

2. Do you think we should allow screenshots of X content, if direct links are banned?

3. Are there are other measures you would like to see implemented, in regards to X?

4. Other major sports subreddits are making similar moves to ban X. Should r/soccer join this movement?

Thank you!
