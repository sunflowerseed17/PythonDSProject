When I measure the output voltage of a dimmer it stays constant (237V) no matter on what brightness I set it. But when I plug in a 100w incandescent light I can regulate it's brightness without issue. The dimmer also says it needs minimum 25w otherwise it doesn't work, does this explain why the voltage doesn't change without a load?
