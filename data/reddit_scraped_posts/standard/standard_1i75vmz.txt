I (23M) am seeing a girl (24F), and we’ve been talking about becoming sexually active. Neither of us are virgins—she’s had one committed relationship, and it’s my first. I had one FWB situation in the past, but I always used protection. It’s also been 24 months since my last sexual activity, so I’m not very sexually active.

I have some boundaries when it comes to sex, one of which is always using a condom. I also requested that she get a blood test for STIs (Hep A/B, HIV, etc.) for peace of mind. I’ve already had a blood test recently and am immune to Hep B, but I think it’s important for both of us to ensure we’re safe. I want to be respectful of both our sexual health and make sure we’re protected in the future.

However, when I brought this up, she got really offended. She said I can’t control her body and implied that I don’t trust her. I tried to explain that it’s just a precautionary measure and that I’m clean, but she still seemed upset.

Am I asking for too much? Should I have just dropped it or was my request reasonable given the situation? How should I approach this going forward?
