What are the most important jobs and jobs that has the most influence on humanity other than scientists and engineers? Since everyone knows scientists and engineers are like the gods on earth that changes the world, moves humanity forward so i want to exclude them. 

Wouldn’t it be Doctors? 

Lets look at it as if we remove this person how much if would effect humanity. If it doesn’t really have much of an influence I wouldn’t say it’s one of the most important jobs in the world. Like for example if the most important artist in the entertainment industry like The Beatles never existed it wouldn’t affect humanity at all, yes it would change the entertainment industry in music, music would be different though, at the end of the day its an entertainment we enjoy it we pay tickets to watch them sing or dance in front of us. Wouldn’t affect humanity we still have music anyways, artist would still exist and people are going to be fans of them. We got wheels, smartphones, medical inventions, lightbulb etc. If we remove someone like Alexander Fleming or Dennis Ritchie it would affect humanity in a huge way. Just like music if one of them never existed theres going to be people that would invent/make that they did but would take longer, and during those years without their inventions its going to have huge influence in the world in a bad way not the same as if an artist that first started using autotune, made every artist copy him disappeared we wouldn’t hear the auto tune influenced songs by other artist too, yeah it does nothing to humanity.
Anyways,

So if we exclude scientists and engineers I would say it’s doctors.
