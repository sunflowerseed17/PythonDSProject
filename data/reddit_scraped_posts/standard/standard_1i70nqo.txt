I'd argue that these are by far the most useless boots in the game right now. Almost no one is building these right now besides Nasus and even then I'd argue there's probably much better options for him. 

The feats version of them is alright but it's definitely on the weaker end with berserker's.   
  
  
10 ability haste and a little bit more summoner haste is just terrible especially compared to Steelcaps, Mercury Treads and Swiftness boots. 



I think giving boots of lucidity 20 ability haste but increase the price up 1050 would be pretty reasonable. I think the feats upgrade should then give 30 ability haste instead.
