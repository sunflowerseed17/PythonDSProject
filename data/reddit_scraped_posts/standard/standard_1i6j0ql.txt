So my fix is not permanently solving this issue. After buying my house and checking things under the crawlspace I noticed that the main sewer pipe is resting against The corner of a concrete pier. It was cutting a notch into the pipe. I cut this piece of stainless and strapped it to the pipe as a temporary fix and it's been holding for years. Unfortunately it's cutting a notch in the steel pipe too!

Is there any way to fix this other than just getting a chisel and chipping away at the pier? I don't want to stress the pipe fitting by pulling it away from the pier. That's just asking for more problems.
