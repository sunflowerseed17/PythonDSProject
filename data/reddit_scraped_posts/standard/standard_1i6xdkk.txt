So curious let’s say I’m an orc with +5 to axes. At what point is a weapon upgrade worth it? 

As an example: 
Let’s say I’m level 20 and I have a 2h axe with 16 dps 

but a possible upgrade comes along a 2h sword with 20dps. 

Is the loss of weapon skill worth the dps upgrade?

I understand there’s multiple factors involved such as weapon speed and stats but is there a general rule of thumb concerning this?
