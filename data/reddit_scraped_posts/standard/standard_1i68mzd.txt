I’ve had this laptop for about 7 years and this is the second time it breaks. MacBooks are so delicate omfg. 

And I was washing clothes when I noticed the water in the washer wouldn’t stop running. The drum was filling and all I could do was get buckets to get the water out. The valve was stuck. 

All this happened in the span of an hour. 

A few weeks before this, my cars’ ac messed up and I needed to get a new compressor. And here I thought that would be my “big” purchase and worth it. 

😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
