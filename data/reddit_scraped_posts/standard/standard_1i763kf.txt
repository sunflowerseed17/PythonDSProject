current build is an asus prime z370-p ii motherboard with a intel i7 9700k cpu and a rtx 2070. was thinking about buying a new pc but if i could get away with slapping a newer card in and getting another cpu down the road that'd be alot easier on my wallet. was looking at going to a 4060 ti or a 4070
