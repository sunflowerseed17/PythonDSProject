Title: It's logical that we can't be immune to fire and electric dmg, but why not vs gas dmg?

It makes sense that we can only become fire or electric dmg resilient with the help of specialised gear.    
    
But gas dmg, why can't gas resistance armour grant immunity to gas dmg?    
It would make sense that we can completely protect ourselves against gases, no?    
    
Fire is... Fire, and the fire we use is from what I understand napalm... And napalm... Yeah, you can't just put on a suit and suddenly be immune to that.       
    
Electricity, for example the tesla tower...    
We're talking about amounts of electricity that without protective gear ^*(resistance armour)* it'll instantly kill us. And like that wasn't enough, the electric arc carry enough energy to instantly vaporise all liquids in our body and make us explode with limbs decorating the surroundings.    
    
Thinking purely rationally, we can't **completely** protect ourselves against such insane levels of electric energy.    
    
...    
    
But gases?    
That's another thing, logically we can protect ourselves against that, can't we?        
    
I would argue that gas resilient armour could at the very least have 95% gas dmg resistance.    
    
Gameplay wise, it would also make sense.    
Gas doesn't deal as much dmg as fire for example, and it's not corrosive like acid.    
So, a hazmat suit would do the job just fine, and us being Helldivers with an available warbond that specialises in gas warfare.  Perhaps it'd be rational to say we are given air tight armour with a gas-proof rebreather?
