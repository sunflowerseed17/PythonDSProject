I've bought the Assassin's Creed and Far Cry series on sale; I've loved these games on console so I'd love to experience it new and hopefully with mods on PC. However, I've just downloaded Brotherhood and after launching, it shows me the CD key, and then nothing happens. It doesn't crash, it doesn't request the key, it doesn't even claim its loading on my steam, nothing happens.

  
I have downloaded Ubisoft connect, made an account and cannot link it to my steam account because the option isn't even there.

  
What do I do? I know Ubisoft has fallen apart recently, but have I just been scammed?
