Ok what are the odds of the four star material? Cause I spent all my energy and I only got 2 of the 4 star ones like why is this in the game?!? Literally every thing is gambling at this point at the stats the substats and even this at this point the story is also a gamble of if the story will be a happy one like the developer said or will it not like every effing time LIKE JUST DO WHAT ZZZ DOES JUST MAKE IT A 100% AT MAX LEVEL. IT WOULD STILL TAKE DAYS TO MAX A CHARACTER.
