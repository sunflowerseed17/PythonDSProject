I played BG3 quite heavily over a year ago and had an assortment of mods to play character builds I wanted to try in real life, but never got a chance. Once I returned, I realized the modding has changed significantly and nothing that I had still worked. Mods I’m trying to find include the following and it would be greatly appreciated if someone could point me in the right direction.

- Orc as a player race from Volo’s Guide to Monsters
- Brute Fighter subclass from Unearthed Aracana
- Path of the Totem Warrior Barbarian subclass
