Edit: I try reseating my gpu and found out that latch at the back of the my pcie slot is broken and cannot not be press down all the way. after I sigh for 1 minute, I decided to just press the gpu towards the pcie slot with light force and put everything back together and its now sowing **pcie 3.0 x16**. **I don't know what to feel now.**

I dont know what's going on with my life man, with this pcie speed I cant even play persona 5 royal at 60fps

I bought this computer back in december 2019, noticed performance decreased in apex legend in 2022 and 2023 but didn't know it was gpu pcie x2 problem.

at 2024 october 13th I notice my gpu pcie running at 3.0 x2 instead of 3.0 x16 while playing persona 5 royal. after that, I sent my computer to local shop for repair, and it worked.

but now after 3 month, it's running at x2 speed again right after I install japanese gal game and gta 4 complete editon.

Is it possible that software can affect the speed of my gpu pcie speed?
