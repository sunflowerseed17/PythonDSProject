I haven't played OSRS for 3-4 years but I'll hop on and play the Leagues mode every so often. But recently there's been a huge surge of Jagex hate, comparing it to the past shitty decision they made to implement EOC, against the wishes of the player base.

From what I can gather, Jagex has been or is going to be purchased by some venture capitalist group and the scare is that membership prices will be hiked up? RuneLite, a third party client, will be banned and plugins will be locked behind a subscription model?
