Just got enough for the 6 piece bonus on my rogue. I don't see these pieces listed in the wowhead phase 2 list, and icy veins lists only 5 pieces as pre raid bis for some reason? 

Can anyone tell me how good this set is with the 6 piece bonus? Is it something I just wear until I get MC gear or should I hold off on breaking it up?

  
Side note: I think a hunter tried to ninja the pants from me but he lost the roll, would a hunter actually need on shadowcraft gear?
