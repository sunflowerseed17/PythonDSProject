this is based on personal opinion/experience! like a character that you simply find annoying to play against without too much reason “just because” like if you had to chance to hit a overwatch character in the face who would it be? 
i’ll go first doomfist, getting punched into a wall randomly and suddenly going down 150hp isn’t fun especially while i’m tryna heal my tank makes me wanna rage everytime and also junkrat like why does he exist 90% of his kills he isn’t even trying.
