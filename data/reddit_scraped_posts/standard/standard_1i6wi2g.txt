According to the Bay County Sheriff’s Office, Octavia Wells, 41, sent a text asking to purchase fentanyl before she left town. She thought she was texting a drug dealer, but accidentally texted a narcotics investigator with the sheriff’s office. 

The investigator began communicating with Wells and went undercover, setting up the “sale of fentanyl.”
