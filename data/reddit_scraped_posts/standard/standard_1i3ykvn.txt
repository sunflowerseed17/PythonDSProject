[https://www.reddit.com/r/Fauxmoi/comments/1i0t2im/tiktok\_refugees\_make\_chinese\_app\_rednote\_the\_most/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fauxmoi/comments/1i0t2im/tiktok_refugees_make_chinese_app_rednote_the_most/) I don't get it, there are other similar alternatives that aren't in a different language. Everyone from TikTok just posts their content on both Tiktok and youtube shorts, so they should be the same. Am i missing something? It's probably difficult to use a Chinese app. Are we downloading rednote just to spite the US government or something?
