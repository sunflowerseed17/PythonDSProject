This was either damaged before we moved in and didn’t notice or during the move and noticed it after when it was raining because I realized I need to stall rain gutters. Anyway, is this a threshold or a weather proofing sill for the door? I found pictures that say different things. What do I need to look for at Lowe’s/homedepot to have this fixed and what is the “how to” to replace it. I’ve checked YouTube and TikTok but didn’t produce the results I was looking for
