I think the Saints are bracing for Aaron Glenn to accept the position with the Jets. They haven't booked anything as far as travel (not that the snow would allow it) it sure sounds like they're getting things lined up for next steps. But if he for some reason says no to New York, he'd be back in play.

If I had to guess, I think Mike McCarthy is their next top choice, and I was actually surprised they waited so long to set things up with him given how interested they were in him early on while still under contract with Dallas. Sources in the building were giving him some strong endorsements. I might be reading too much into that, but that's just my instinct from covering the team.

But Kafka and Weaver remain in play and will interview as soon as the weather clears up. McCarthy is also expected to interview this week in person.
