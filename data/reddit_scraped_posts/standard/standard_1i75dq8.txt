 Yesterday my RGB were working fine until I had to turn off my PC and go out with friends. I just came back to absolutely no light on my RGB fans except for my watercooling. I went to MSI Center and then Mystic Light to try to get them back on but it just asks me loads of updates and updates. Never had any problem since I had my PC except the fact that it was super laggy. It asked me to update MSI Center itself, then Mystic Light and then when I updated all of that, it asks me for a scan where I have to update the AMD Chipset Driver (for my CPU) and install their « Norton 360/MSI LED FW) and I did it all of that (except Norton) and still not working. I even download the AMD Chipset Driver from my MSI MB Support page and still nothing. My PC became laggy since I reinstalled the AMD Chipset Driver multiple times + updated my BIOS via Flash EZ (usb stick) and I consider doing a factory reset maybe. What can I do?
