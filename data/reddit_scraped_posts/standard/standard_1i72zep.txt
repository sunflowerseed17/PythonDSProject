So I (21f) work as a cashier at a restaurant. I’m the only morning cashier at my job and I work Monday through Friday 11AM-5PM. It leaves me with very little time before or after work to handle important things and it’s always been an issue if I get sick because no one else can cover my shift. My coworkers are all in school. And I can never really get my shifts covered if I need them. I’m in school too- but I do all my classes online, it’s asynchronous.  

I’m good at this job- and I do whatever they ask. Catering orders that need to be packed? I come in early and help. Another location needs someone to come in? Where am I headed, I’m on my way. I don’t want to say I do too much- but I do what they ask of me.

Recently I got a new job- it offers me better pay, and benefits (which I don’t have at my current job) and they even agreed to be flexible with my schedule. And we only work Sunday-Thursday which leaves me Fridays to handle any type of important appointments and things if needed. I got the job on my day off 1/18 and was going to put in my notice that same day- but was advised by my AM (who happens to be my aunt and got me this job) to wait until she gets back from her vacation so we can work it out together. However- my new job gave us the training schedule and it’s the next week, which is the week that would have been my last here at my current job. I cannot use my PTO because there isn’t anyone who can work my shift- and I would need to get these days covered but I can’t. 

I don’t want to leave unprofessionally however I don’t see any other options. AITA?
