I honestly love this game, but bothers me the fact the builds revolve around items and not your character sheet. Yeah, stats, skills, spells and feats take importance too but they can be completely shaped depending the item you're wearing.
The items are so overpowered that they can make you dump an stat and consequently allowing you to pump another (hi Hill Giant pot, House of Hope items, headband of intellect, etc)... Doesn't that literally make the some classes and play styles better than others? 
I always get a strange feeling when I see a build that "will come online around level X after I get an item in Act 2 or 3", I feel like it's unbalancing the game.
Also, bothers me the fact that some status effects are fully supported by items and others aren't.
What's your thoughts on this? 
I didn't want to be rude, I'm not a game designer but after hours and some runs I think this game is unbalanced for some classes.
