Earlier today I had a lot of homework to do, namely Linear Algebra and Physics, so a lot of math.

I don't typically listen to music when I work. I feel like it distracts me more than anything. But I had pigstep stuck in my head, so I threw on my headphones and set it to shuffle after playing it once.

What followed was possibly the most zen experience of my life for the next 2-3 hours. Time flew by as I finished question after question. Despite all of the relatively boring and headache inducing work, my mind just went with the flow.

And as I thought about it, what I was doing was not unlike how Minecraft is designed. When you play Minecraft, you're doing the same few things hundreds and hundreds of times: walking around, digging and placing blocks... on the surface, it is monotonous and repetitive. Not unlike a bunch of math homework.

But something about the music takes that boring, repetitive gameplay loop and changes it to one of peace and serenity. Its calming presence puts you in an almost meditative state.

So, the next time you have a bunch of work to do, maybe try listening to the Minecraft soundtrack.
