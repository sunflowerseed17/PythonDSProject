My sister and I were super close growing up, but things changed when I had my daughter. She’s 8 now, and my whole world. My sister, on the other hand, has always been a little...self absorbed.

The issue started last week. My daughter has a big dance recital coming up, and I promised I’d be there. It’s a huge deal to her. But then my sister called, saying she’s throwing a last-minute birthday party the same day and expects me to come. I told her I can’t because of the recital, and she lost it, calling me selfish and saying I always "put my kid first."

She even dragged our mom into it, who thinks I should "compromise" and leave the recital early to make an appearance. But I feel like my kid should come first, especially since I already committed to her event. My sister says I’m prioritizing my daughter over my "real family." That comment stung.

Now the family group chat is blowing up, and everyone has an opinion. Some say I’m right, others say I’m being unfair to my sister. I don’t think I’m wrong, but now I’m second guessing myself. AITAH?
