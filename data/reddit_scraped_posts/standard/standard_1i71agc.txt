Welcome to the Jadavpur University Anime Awards 2024! Brought to you by the JU Anime Society!

Get ready to celebrate the magic of anime! This year, we honour the incredible stories, characters, and creators that have captured our hearts. Special tribute goes to Akira Toriyama, whose legendary work, Dragon Ball, continues to inspire fans across generations.

These awards feature 22 categories divided among 4 sections. Each category features 6 nominees from anime, which have aired from January 1, 2024 to December 31st, 2024, of which only ONE can be voted by YOU.

So, vote for your favourites and help crown the best of the best. Don't forget, voting ends on Saturday, 25th January at 11:59 PM. Make your voices heard and let’s make this celebration as epic as an anime finale!
