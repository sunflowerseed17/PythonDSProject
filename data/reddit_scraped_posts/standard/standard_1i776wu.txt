Bearing in mind it could theoretically cure Karlach or Astarion, and how game-breaking it is for it to be a common item, I am choosing to believe (at least in my head) that the scroll is a super duper rare thing - maybe even something of mythical status that people don't really believe exists. That's the problem with media that has to cure death - robs it of alot of power.

But in-canon, or at least logically, where did Gale get it? Did he make it? Could he make more? I doubt it. I'm assuming Elminster or Mystra gave it to him, a failsafe - so that he could at least make sure to get far away from people before he exploded. Once the scroll was gone, he had to pack up and get as far away from civilization as he could.
