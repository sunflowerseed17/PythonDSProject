So my friends and I did a good play through of BG3, we finished it yesterday, but we found an issue with the adjustable party limit. We all wanted our own romances (obviously), but after a certain point, Astarion (my romance) and Shadowheart (my friend's romance) just.. stopped? There was no chance to process the romance no matter what we did. The odd thing is that my boyfriend romanced Wyll and was able to complete the romance despite switching followers for certain quests. Has anyone else encountered this issue? Of course, I expect mods to cause issues, but I wasn't expecting it to halt our romances.
