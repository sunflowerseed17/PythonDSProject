Trying to figure out the best way to deal with the various summoned bosses (since I'm tired of running dungeons and the second oil rig for getting bad bp's).

Basic Bellanoir was simple to fight, just throw out a base full (17 on the server my friend runs) of lvl 55+ and beat into submission.

Tried Bellanoir libero, and they absolutely stomped my (now nearly lvl 60) army.  So I said stuff it, figured 'why not try base defenses'.  Spent a couple days building up over 1200 rockets, built a giant metal box, with a ton of rocket launcher stations. At first it seemed I was doing decent damage, then she teleported on top of a wall, death lasered and melted an entire wall, ruining the assault and turning it into a free for all of crumbling building pieces.  'almost' won.. got down to 50k hp left of phase 2.  

  
Wound up scrapping remained standing, tidying up my mess.  Afraid to try blazemut ryu, if libero was that devastating.

  


my next thought is to set them all up on one wall and do a volley or wall of fire type, so that she has less chance to teleport on top of them. 

  
Anyone have any suggestions on how to fight the raid bosses, short of 'smash my face off oil rigs' till I get something that isn't a blue assault rifle bp.  I got 1 green MLRS bp, but I don't think that things gonna give the little 'tip' of damage I need, over using the plasma launcher.
