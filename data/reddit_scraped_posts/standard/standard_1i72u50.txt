In a nutshell there’s a lot of ways a heavy blended ele/enh makes sense.

Sure you sacrifice your I win button and meh stormstrike but it’s possible to dip far enough to get both 100% damage to spell crits and flurry. Elemental devastation feeds into your wind flurry engine, you can get clear casting and eye of storm to help get a heal off after. With some trinkets and the right gear I think it’s a fairly viable spec.

Plays okay in open world pve so far might take it
