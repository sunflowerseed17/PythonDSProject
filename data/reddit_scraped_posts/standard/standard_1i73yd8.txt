Not just with my game btw, also happening to my friend. Go in range and shoot tracer's gun. Or soldier. Or mei m2. Almost every character has a form of screen shake. Still have screen shake set to reduced in the settings. Is the setting bugged? How are there no other threads complaining about this?
