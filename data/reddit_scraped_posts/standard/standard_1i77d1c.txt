My rx 7800xt has been underperforming for some time now, usually experiencing roughly 20% -30% less fps in games than benchmarks and other users with the same card have experienced. I was under the impression that my Cpu is an intel i7-11700 would pair alright with my card but i could be wrong. ill greatly appreciate anyone letting me know if cpu is the issue or maybe there is something im missing.

  
Specs:

Rx 7800xt
