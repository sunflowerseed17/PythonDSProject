Title: Radon Mitigation - 3” to 4” adapter to start, pointless to continue with 4” pipe?

I installed this sump cover today to prep for a radon mitigation DIY install. The cover has a threaded 3” PVC inlet and appears to be the biggest adapter it came with. I was planning on using 4” pipe for the entire run but in an effort to not modify this cover I want to use a 3” to 4” adapter. 

I’m not an expert on pressure or WC etc. Considering I would have a 3” hole at the start, even if the rest is 4”, I assume I am missing the benefit of 4” pipe then? So I would be better off using 3” and saving money with a slightly less effective system?
