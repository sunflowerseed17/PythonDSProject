I just finished watching this movie for the first time and holy shit it’s the best thing I’ve watched so far in my life. It’s that mix between a crime thriller and pureblood horror and I ADORE it. I usually pause movies to comment on it to myself and to think, but with M I waited until the very end before just letting my jaw drop.
