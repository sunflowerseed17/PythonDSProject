Hey guys,

does anyone else see the resemblance between Arlecchino and Ronova? Her weekly boss really strengthens that in my opinion consideirng that her moves and attacks sometimes look like Ronovas eyes? May she be an avatar from Ronova or is she somehow holding the power of her?   
As far as I know it was revealed to Arlecchino and us that she is a descendant from the once royal bloodline Crimson Moon Dynasty of Khaenri'ah. That is appereantly also the reason for her powers and also curse. However I don't recall any offical statement of what exactly her power is.

So I'm curious about your theories or maybe I missed some information about that. Anyways, thank you for reading and a pleasent day to all of you.
