I have the Nokia Router (gigabit service) and in its management site -> Network -> Wireless 2.4/5ghz I'm seeing SSID Select with SSID 2-4 and 6-8 with the SSID being named Nokia. It's probably a stupid question but can I use them to create a guest account?  
Also should I enable Mu-MIMO? I have patchy coverage in my flat, even though it's small and the bedroom drops signal.  
Ultimately I plan to use a TP Link AX50, but I'm holding off for sale price drops so may be using the Nokia for a couple of months yet.  
Cheers!
