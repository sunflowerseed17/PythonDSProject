Hello guys, i have a PC build but has a lot of design tax on it.

Can someone suggest a strong pc build, that has a simpler, cheaper (yet still ok looking) design ?  
Good temperatures aswell

this is the build reference: [https://be.pcpartpicker.com/list/qXMfpK](https://be.pcpartpicker.com/list/qXMfpK)

  
Thank you all in advance for your help.
