Hopefully 1.0 will be playable without an Internet connection on Xbox. 

Really needing a constant Internet connection on Xbox is the only thing keeping me from having it download permanently.

What are y'all's thoughts, think 1.0 should be playable without an Internet connection?


Edit: so I downloaded pal world on Xbox series s then I went to my Xbox settings and changed it to offline then tried to start up the game, even went so far as to start the game while online then changing to offline. 

As of January 22 2025 you cannot play pal world offline on Xbox.
