Copy pasted from my twitter. This was supposed to explore Yingxing's character thematically but I was worried that it was getting too subjective, thus this essay became a glorified character recap. That being said, I hope this is still helpful to anyone learning about him.

I am also aware that the EN translation loses the depth of the original CN text and as such I will only briefly address them when relevant. However, please feel free to make corrections or provide additional context!

In a similar vein, this is not an analysis about any cultural or religious references regarding his character. I might touch on some symbolism here and there, but I do not believe I am qualified to go in-depth contextually when it comes to Chinese media.

**BACKGROUND**

Let us start with Yingxing's background, which is fairly consistent across various sources. All of them inform us that:

1. He pledged to avenge his family by waging war against the Abundance. Baiheng and Jingliu specifically implies that he plans to devote his entire life to the cause. This is further supported by spiel about sacrifices shortly after Baiheng's death.

As far as we know, Blade has no memory of his family or the subsequent quest for vengeance, only that he travelled to Xianzhou to learn. He subconsciously harbours a hatred for the Abundance, as evident by his self-deprecation, describing himself as a "monstrosity".

2. He specifically sought out the Zhuming to learn artifex technologies, having boarded a merchant vessel heading to the flagship. It can be implied that he had an affinity for crafting beforehand and had been aware of the war between hunt and abundance.

Intriguingly, Yingxing seems extraordinarily efficient and goal-oriented for a child who barely survived the slaughter of his family and home world. Which leads to the following point.

**GENIUS ARTISAN**

Yingxing is a prodigy. Well yeah, no shit, but it's amusing how often they just shove this fact into your face.

[Yingxing is big brained](https://preview.redd.it/krl1c9brlhee1.jpg?width=3508&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d181ebb3d9470447070538eac519c1eeea180deb)

Baiheng even mentions the Genius Society and whether Yingxing would have qualified to be a member in another life is debatable (in my opinion, no) it's still an intriguing parallel.

This natural intellect is further backed by the fact that Blade (when not marastruck) has been shown to be logical, perceptive and even suggested to be able to easily solve puzzles.

[Blade is also big brained](https://preview.redd.it/ltyvc430mhee1.jpg?width=3508&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=488ecefbb8be52e2f642b897580c3cd4dc12c3eb)

**FURNACE MASTER**

Later as a young adult, we could speculate that he moved to Luofu (maybe at Huaiyan's suggestion) to obtain the position of Furnace Master.

[That guy from the Zhuming](https://preview.redd.it/7jeqaz88mhee1.jpg?width=3508&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5cff1b588ed9b416792fb41a6953e65b018e4ce9)

What's notable is that Luocha and Xueyi even treat  Yingxing's hailing from the Zhuming as a distinguishing characteristic, particularly the former, as both Baiheng and Jingliu came from other ships but were never mentioned.

**FLYING COMET**

Yingxing is a short-lived species in a civilisation full of immortals, and his entire character embodies mortals' transient but fervent wills. He literally mentions his limited lifespan almost every time he speaks. It is so ingrained in his identity and way of living, serving as a statement against those who discriminate on such grounds.

[Xianzhou racism is crazy](https://preview.redd.it/mpj9mverohee1.jpg?width=3508&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8ab32ca582946b213ae43300c71fe6460482e8d)

In CN, his "I'd rather leave this world in a blaze" reads something like "I would rather be a firefly chasing flame, than live through many springs as dull wood." Even the moniker "flying comet" can be translated as "shooting star," referring not only to his ephemeral brilliance but also to his name, which means "to answer the stars."

Now, let’s look at his actual accomplishments, beginning with his renowned masterpieces, the High Cloud Quintet weapons.

**SHARD SWORD**

I could write an entirely separate essay on how the HCQ weapons represent Yingxing's relationship with each of their owners, notably Shard Sword, which aside from portraying his dynamic with Jingliu offers such a blatant narrative parallel to himself. While that's another topic for another day, I'd like to talk about why Shard Sword is considered his magnum opus, or at least his most attributed work.

[Shard Sword](https://preview.redd.it/xigmywuxmhee1.jpg?width=2480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4acdca15a330bfb0d06847c016c251443ad35dc7)

The reveal of the Shard Sword marked a pivotal moment in Yingxing's career. Sabotaging the Sword Champion's crowning ceremony to toss his work in front of a crowd then yapping about how skilled his craft is was not only proof of his competence, but also an offering of his utility to the Cloud Knights.

Jingliu constantly highlights Yingxing's defiant nature. From the way he utilises unconventional materials to how he caused a SCENE (from memory, the CN states he created an uproar), one of his most distinguishing characteristics is his dissident mindset towards both his profession and position in Xianzhou society.

[Defiant nature](https://preview.redd.it/ghsiu8g2nhee1.jpg?width=3508&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5038bf65ae2ce2b2c189cf6c03ca0c66d344268d)

Swords crafted by Huaiyan's apprentices (Yingxing, Hanguang, and Yunli) have comparable design principles. I am coping that Shard Sword and Guyun are especially alike to foreshadow how they will handle Blade's development, i.e. seeking to rest as no longer as weapon.

[Huaiyan's apprentices](https://preview.redd.it/aeehkxg4nhee1.jpg?width=3244&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de0eb6409a5e6450848b2fc8d589dcb6cd588433)

STARFALL REVERIE

One of our earliest explicit references to Yingxing came from Fu Xuan while discussing Starfall Reverie! While it seems that Lightning Lord takes the weapon of the current general, it's hard to tell cause it appears they referenced the same model for Teng Xiao.

[Starfall Reverie](https://preview.redd.it/c1a6itv6nhee1.jpg?width=3508&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8420336b6e67f7aa8c462582ad8d2f23e46ff60)

Both Shard Sword and Starfall Reverie are also comically heavy but hey I guess peepaw Yingxing lifts.

[WHY IS IT THAT HEAVY ](https://preview.redd.it/97r6wfy8nhee1.jpg?width=3508&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6c733a6dc1269549fd936d705d48a6b6791dbaa2)

**RECURVE BOW**

It exploded, like its owner, I guess. Given that we don't even have a name for Baiheng's bow, I'll take the opportunity to talk about the flask he made for her instead. As stated in the deleted relic description, this is one of his more personal works yet it still stresses how the quality is deemed extraordinary.

[Passerby's bottle of plenty](https://preview.redd.it/dovm86ubnhee1.jpg?width=3508&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7106325b886d7a0d8ac480bf04814960c336e7c8)

**CLOUDPIERCER**

Likewise, Cloudpiercer also suffers from model reusage with the HE statue, though in this case, I'm almost certain it was made for Dan Feng, given the engraving of 'Dan' and the HCQ's awareness of his identity struggles.

Similar to Shard Sword, I could go on a tangent about how Dan Heng treating Cloudpiercer as his own weapon rather than Dan Feng's represents how he accepts his past yet has built himself a new identity beyond it. To quote ichor, ("You are my past but you will not follow me into the future"), sorta deal.

>!Anyway, we’re talking about Yingxing so LOOK at how everyone glazed our master craftsman in Amphoreus.!<

[Cloudpiercer](https://preview.redd.it/rufzypiinhee1.jpg?width=3508&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fc8a94ec882ec757eb34230f93016b9933f9583a)

**UNNAMED SWORD**

There’s actually one HCQ weapon that faded in obscurity and it’s Yingxing's own sword! While it’s not confirmed that he crafted it himself I still want to bring it up as it sometimes shows up in Blade’s official media.

[Unnamed sword](https://preview.redd.it/cu755tnrnhee1.jpg?width=3158&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=03260b5f95579102c96df26b62712c96619e8bf9)

Both his splash art and an advertisement feature it in a sword graveyard, supporting Blade's perception of Yingxing being dead. It could also possibly be an homage to the Zhuming tradition of collecting the swords of deceased opponents, again implying Blade feels he is the one who symbolically killed the craftsman.

[Sword graveyard](https://preview.redd.it/pvfm834unhee1.jpg?width=3508&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ac9876680643d23c6d3fb8fcb79b63fca91ae659)

**MISC. CRAFTS**

Yingxing is said to have created "hundreds of marvels" during his lifetime, which supposedly included straitjackets for criminals dangerous enough to share a floor with Hoolay.

Speaking of the Borisin, it's implied that Yingxing did eventually develop those specialised anti-mechabeast  automatons he vowed as a child. Moreover, that lifelike mechanical lion he created out of rubbish was an intentional sabotage, according to CN, which isn't evident given how EN used the word "challenge"

[Misc. crafts](https://preview.redd.it/bjnuib78ohee1.jpg?width=3508&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5d093defcff50c4ab9d3e88f76751874b8918c3b)

**LEGACY**

While I am also not interested in commenting on that tomfuckery known as sedition lore, I do want to discuss the disparity between Xianzhou politics and his untainted reputation.

It seems that the Arbiter Generals (it makes sense for Jing Yuan and Huaiyan to know Blade = Yingxing, but Feixiao?) and the Ten Lords Commission are involved in some form of coverup.

[Sus sedition stuff](https://preview.redd.it/zp67pfvfohee1.jpg?width=3508&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=42e4024f3eb0f1c12d3bba3901e51b6633bdca15)

This could merely be them retroactively assigning criminal status as Blade, but the lack of information on Yingxing post-sedition and pre-jingliu, as well as the use of the word "exile" in passerby set, suggests otherwise.

In conclusion, I feel many misconceptions about Blade stem from a lack of recognition of how he is effectively a reflection of Jingliu (the removed relic item for her is literally a mirror) and a misunderstanding of what Yingxing's character actually stands for.

Many of the qualities we see in Blade were already present in Yingxing i.e. tying your identity to your skills/utility, devoting your life to vengeance, but are now taken to the extreme. Yet, Blade's existence is also the antithesis of most of his values, which contributes to his disassociation from his humanity.

Anyway, thank you for reading! It felt weird to write a tribute on the enduring legacy of a character who is still alive.
