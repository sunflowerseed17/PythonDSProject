I grew up, as a child, in the days of the Xbox 360/PS3/Wii. But my home consoles were an NES and PS2. Once I hit high school and got a 360, I would join public lobbies but rarely speak. I was always social in person, but something has always stopped me from joining public lobbies. Even to this day, one of the first settings I change is that I mute public voice chat. I want to make online friends gaming, but I can't do that if I don't talk.

Am I the only one who struggles with this?
