so far ive only played like 5 games of it but ive had literally 0 issues. ive seen people report bugs of teams somehow getting 3 tanks 3 supports but bugs are gonna happen day one. 

the thing is 6v6 role queue is good but there are problems. queue times are the entire reason blizzard switched to 5v5. doesnt matter how good a game is, if you cant play it without waiting for 20 minutes people wont play it.

this mode gives you the ability to at least always have a tank on the team but still have okay queue times with 6v6. wiill you get teammates that go 3 tank, 2dps and 1 support then all lose? yes but thats up to everyone on the team to not be an idiot and do that.
