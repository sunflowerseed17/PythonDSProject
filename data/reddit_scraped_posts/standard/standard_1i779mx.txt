I know this isnâ€™t the first thank you post but I just felt the need to say my thank you to the developers of this game. This game has been a big part of my life and despite the constant criticism it might get I do recognize the amount of love you all have put into this game. I am very excited to see what you all have in store for the future of this game and hope you all know there are many people who appreciate what you do. Thank you!
