I hopped on Overwatch just to see what was in my "Maximilien's Vault" 

I had the spare coins just already in my account, so I picked up the venture skin and closed the game. Some friends shared what they got in theirs, so I reopened the game to go and take a screen shot and this is what greeted me. The shop trying to sell me the venture skin I literally just bought 2 minutes earlier....
