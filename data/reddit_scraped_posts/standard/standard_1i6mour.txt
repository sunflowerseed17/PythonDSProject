I am suffering gaming burnout, of a sort. But not typical burnout in that I hate games, in fact im very excited to play a lot of them. I have a backlog of 80ish and i'm really excited to play *most* of them. But I boot it up and quickly feel *'i'm not in the mood'*

I can identify that a lot of this is my own expectations,  I'm personally a huge soulslike fan and seem to be stuck in a loop off *'I have Platinumed Elden Ring, its now stale and want to play something new' --> This new game isn't as good as Elden Ring, i should just play elden ring --> etc.'* 

I work full time, and currently have two young children, so other hobbies or Gym time aren't really possible right now, as normally I would take a break from gaming if I felt like this. 

Has anyone experience this, and how to I shake it off and start enjoying new games again?
