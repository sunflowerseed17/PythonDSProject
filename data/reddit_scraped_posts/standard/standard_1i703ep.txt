A little context:

I’m stuck at work for the next 12 hours on standby - just waiting to see if SHTF. I have a work laptop that is definitely not meant for gaming (7th gen i5, integrated graphics), but I have full unfettered access to install whatever I want on it. So I figured I’d install steam and see if it will play *something* to pass the time. I’ve got the laptop tethered to my phone.

I fire steam up and it gives me the option to stream everything I have installed on my home PC, which I thought was only possible on a local network. I figured I’d give that a shot anyways and of course it wants a 4-digit code punched into my home PC, which I obviously can’t do since I’m at work.

So I go ahead and install Surviving Mars and hope it’ll play decent enough at the lowest graphics. After install, I hit play and Steam instead tells me that it’s going to stream it from my home PC instead. I hit “Ok” and the game fires up! The 3D play area is kinda blurry, but the UI is perfectly legible. And there’s zero latency!

So my question is, how the hell is this working?!
