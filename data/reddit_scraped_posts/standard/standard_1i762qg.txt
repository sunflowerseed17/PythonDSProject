Every time I try to load up the game I get hit with the message “There was an unexpected error, please try again.” Even though I’ve restarted my computer, and uninstalled and reinstalled the game I can’t get past the loading screen. Is this a well known problem with a common/easy solution, or is this a more unique problem I need to look into?
