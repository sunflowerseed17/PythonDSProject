(This is a super late out of the loop but idk where else to ask)

Randomly was checking my subscribed subreddits and remembered that this was one of them, but they would never make it to my front page anymore and it seems to now be restricted to just news articles. 

It used to be a bunch of short videos of justice served moments. Like someone tries to rob a store and then a customer body slams them. Is that a new subreddit now?
