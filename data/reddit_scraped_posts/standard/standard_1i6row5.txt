I have a more expensive frame and its called starck, believe its made of titanium. I noticed its missing a weird looking screw and I rather fix it myself then try to go through warranty or something if possible. I checked amazon and I don't see anything that looks like this and I am assuming its a more expensive piece because its a luxury brand. I need the screw and a tool if anyone has the names :).
