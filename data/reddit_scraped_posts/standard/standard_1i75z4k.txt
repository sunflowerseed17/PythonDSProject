BEFORE ANYTHING I KNOW MY FANS ARE DIRTY I PLAN ON GETTING NEW ONES. Now Ive had my pc for a couple months now but I‚Äôm not sure if my fans are setup correctly. As far as I can tell nothing has been wrong but I just have doubts. 

So the 2 at the front are reverse blade fans and the other 4 are normal fans.

Now I can‚Äôt get to understand if the blade pointing away from you is exhaust are intake just the whole things confuses me. So please just tell me what to fixüôè.
