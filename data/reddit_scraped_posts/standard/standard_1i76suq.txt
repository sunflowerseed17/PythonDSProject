I played about 8 rounds using the stim pistol and lightweight medic Armour. Most fun I've had in a while. Really made me feel like a team. I love shot in the game where a squad is on a dune or mounted up on a ridge so playing support gives me great vibes. Did autamotons and had a lot of thanks. The squid front.. more hectic hard to heal. 

I'm not sure how much support, especially medical based, exist. There supply backpacks and as for gun I only know of the stim pistol. If anybody has anymore let me know.

I wanted to add that I hope we get more support items. I was thinking maybe a power buff beam, sorta like medic in tf2 or maybe a stim backpack that also gives a little ammo. Any orbital ideas I could think of was an area of effect heal or buff if something like the laser I mentioned is thought up. 

Always just had so much fun really playing support and wanted to hear more thoughts.
