So I am having trouble getting started breeding, I know how it all works mathematically whatnot but most my pals with good passives are shitty and will take forever to breed up making it more time consuming but whatever, my pals for some reason not producing ANY wheat at my base despite me having it perfectly stacked just as my other food squares are Is there a reason for this ? It is making getting started on breeding work pals extremely difficult ðŸ˜ž
