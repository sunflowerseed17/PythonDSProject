Everyone says Classic and SoD are both way too easy, you just gear up your character then quit the game. Why don't the devs just make a Classic mode to tune the difficulty on boss fights so that bosses hit way harder and boss encounters demand higher dps/healing? Either that or do the same thing with SoD. No one seems to be discussing this idea, everyone seems to have jumped on the hardcore train.
