I ordered a KitchenAid stand mixer from Amazon. It was delivered in a brown cardboard box clearly branded as a KitchenAid stand mixer.

Inside was another box, in colors, clearly branded as a KitchAid stand mixer.

Maybe one was for shipping, the other for retail display? Still a waste of materials.
