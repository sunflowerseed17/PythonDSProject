My husband (26M) spiked a fever of 104 at around 2:30am last night. He told me (24F) he wanted to go to the ER. I suggested he try to take medicine, a lukewarm shower, put an ice pack on, etc. before we go to the ER (this is the first time he spiked a fever this high and he hadn’t taken any measures to bring it down). He suggested he go by himself and I relied “are you sure?” He got offended that I didn’t argue about going with him. If it were just him and I, I would’ve totally said yes let’s go. But we have a 6 month old baby that goes to daycare at 7am and I felt terrible waking him up to go to a hospital. My husband said I was “showing my true colors” by not wanting to take him. He’s been sick for a couple of days and I’ve been catering to his every need. When I was sick last week and asked for help with the baby he said “when you’re a parent you don’t get to be sick”. Honestly I think this is karma. But AITAH?
