TL;DR I recently installed 5 ceiling fans in my new home using (2) #8 1-1/2 inch particle board screws per fan. The fans weigh about 16 pounds each and are medium sized. The screws are going directly into a stud, and I would guess they are about an inch deep into them. They do not wobble or seem unstable. Should I be concerned?

In hindsight, I should have used some thicker wood screws. I removed the light fixtures that were there previously, and the 1 screw being used to hold the lights in place. The fan directions said to use the screws previously installed, so I went out and bought more of the exact same screw without giving it a second thought. I am really hoping I donâ€™t have to uninstall each fan to replace the screws. The construction supervisor for my neighborhood said that there was nothing to worry about but I am still worrying about it.
