i just got a usb drive for my roku tv (sandisk, 32gb). i plan on using this to watch tv and cartoons through roku's media player, since roku's live tv doesn't have some of the things i want to watch, and i don't want to give streaming services any money. any websites for cartoons i can download onto my flash drive? i prefer direct downloads, but anything works. also, i have protonvpn on my computer for downloading. would any of the websites i visit need a vpn? i'm new to pirating tv shows and cartoons.
