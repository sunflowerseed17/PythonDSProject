Does anyone have any recommendations where to buy a hip flask that can be engraved for nephews 18th? I'm guessing the usual suspects like Slanj and other Kilt hire shops, but can anyone suggest other places to look? There seems to be quite a generic choice out there. I've looked at Dalvey, but they are wanting too much.
