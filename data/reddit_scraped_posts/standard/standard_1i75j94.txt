Hi everybody,

A while ago somebody here made a post detailing all the skins you can purchase through a link rather than the in-game shop. These skins are NOT always available in the in-game shop, but are available through battle.net links.

I've compiled a list of (hopefully) all these skins and put it into [this spreadsheet ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSn7CoLNzETxPFbK7gr1Urg47_JpGhCY5LxrcbuXNw09_6i2Jlak-C1ovXWaPmyoZNmweL_t7YfP4PE/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true)to help me look through it all. I figured I might as well share in case some of you are interested. If I missed anything please let me know! I'd love to have a complete list and will keep it updated.
