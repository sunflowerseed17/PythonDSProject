I’m pretty new to sod, and I recently got into the 50s. I did my first round of feralas incursion quests Sunday. 

Yesterday, I went back out there today to run another set of dailies, but the only things available to me were the mining, skinning, and herbalism turn in quests. Same in hinterlands even though I haven’t done the hinterlands dailies yet. 

Am I missing something or is this working as intended?

The duskwood and ashenvale sets refreshed daily, so I expected the ones in feralas to be available daily also.
