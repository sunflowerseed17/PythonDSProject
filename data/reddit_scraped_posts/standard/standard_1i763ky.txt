Hey Guys! 
I am a WoW player from Germany singe WOTLK, i have been a Paladine Main from the start on! 
Sure, in those years i took a Break from wow or was doing some alt chars.. i missed Vanilla und missed the Classic Launch but i am very interested. 

My question is.. how to start the meaningful journey? Any Addons that Are Must have? Any class i should main? ( i would Go for pala but i dont know if its the right Choice in Classic) 
Are there still groups to find and people to do stuff with on Europe Servers? Wich Realm should i join?
And so on.. the questions in my Head Are stopping me from giving Classic a Shot.. 

Hope for some help 
See you in Azeroth
