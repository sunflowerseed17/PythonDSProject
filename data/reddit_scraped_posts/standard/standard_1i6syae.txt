Hi all, about to embark on a fairly minor renovation project (no wall demos, mostly repainting, adding light fixtures, reworking layout of the room and adding nice furniture in addition to adding a custom closet and other storage solution). We came across Decorilla’s platinum service which includes end to end project management and we’re wondering if anyone has ever used their service and is willing to share their experience? Thank you so much!!
