I'm compiling a google map with multiple layers of different but related info. I'm wanting to track where multiple people walk to add into this. As an example 10 people leafleting a group of streets. Can anyone recommend a free app where the user then sends me their walk that's easy to import into google maps? For extra fun is there a way to fade the colour of a track in the layer over a period of weeks relating to when it was last walked?
Cheers for any help!
