Oh man, the scene where Luffy and Vegapunk talk about his synthetic dragon devil fruit had me dying. Not just because Vegapunk’s a perfectionist, but more so; the amount of time Colleen had to say “Pink, why?” was so short it ended up as Luffy saying, “pinkwhy” without a single breath between. Really caught me off guard, I just started laughing.
