My wife and I bought this house a little over a month ago and a LOT of the windows have this going on where the springy bars of the jamb just don't spring near the bottom, with many having gaps you can see out of. Can anyone help with figuring out how to fix? Google isn't being very helpful

Any and all constructive input is appreciated!
