Okay, I know this website is a more recent release of movies and series, And that you can only access to it anytime if you're in VIP thing, And if you're not in VIP well you're bound to have limited access where at the main bar says "We're sorry..." which means you can't access to it until you have the right time where it eventually says "Welcome!" Where you can access to it wether it's early or later...

But now...since yesterday morning on Monday i've been trying to be patient and tried to wait precise timings for the access to be opened for me, But i've waited for over more than 24 hours to get the chance to access to it and it still says this! What's going on?
