Hoping to get some clear information about people's experiences about installation and removal of peel and stick tiles, or smart tiles, on a kitchen countertop or shower area in a rental, specifically. Our kitchen counter does have a stove and sink as well (see picture). And our bathroom has tiles all along the wall, but they will need to be able to withstand humidity. Listing my specific questions below:

1) One of my concerns is their durability for handling water splashes and possible heating for the tiles in close range to the stove. Does anyone have advice on this (either a brand/type that worked for you, or what didn't work)? 

2) I'm especially concerned about the removal. I'm comfortable taking a mild to moderate risk of having some of our deposit not returned, but we have pretty new counters/bathroom, and I'm having trouble getting consistent feedback online about whether this is too big of a risk or not an issue. Some have said with proper removal, they are clean to take off. However, I've also seen horror stories about adhesive not possible to remove. We're planning to be in this space for 3-5 years, so we would be removing the tiles around this time.

  
Thanks so much in advance, I'm new to DIY/house renovation and really want to do this in a way that will be more cost-efficient while still being able to create our dream home! Please share links to any step-by-step, photos - I appreciate it all!
