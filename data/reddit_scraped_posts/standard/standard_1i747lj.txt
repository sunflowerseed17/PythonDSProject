For some background, my friend has a large channel with about 4K subscribers. Recently, he hasn’t really wanted to post and said he’s going to delete the channel. I asked if I could pilot it because it’s a good channel—why put it to waste? But he got mad at me, saying, “You only want it because it has so many subscribers.” To be honest, it hurt because I told him it was a good channel, but he says I only want it for its subscribers. We came to the agreement that I won’t take it, but he won’t get rid of it in case he ever wants to come back. I still feel hurt, and I want to know if what I said was wrong.
