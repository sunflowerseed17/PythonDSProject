Ontrac delivery is garbage… My package came in the mail ripped open… I finished what the delivery guy started and ripped it completely open. Just to find not my package, but a cheap Chinese assembly line knockoff. What I ordered was a high quality RC drifter car toy with intricate expensive electronics.  THIS AIN’T EVEN THE BRAND I ORDERED! It was just some screwed up, already broken, cheap garbage. I guess someone had the bright idea of stealing my shit and replacing it…I called the people at Ontrac…FLATLINE. So yeah. These people suck.
