Besides all the questions that are here about dev etc... Even though Squadron 42 is set to be launched in 2026, it would still needs to bring enough money for them to keep working on their MMO. When you know they already burnt around 700 millions... makes you wonder. Or maybe they will still raise money? What do you think?
