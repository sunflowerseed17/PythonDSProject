For the mods - is there an automagic conversion bot for this sub that can interpret US Freedom Units of a1c to mmol for those of us elsewhere to understand where we are at?
At my GP today and asked them about conversion mentioning this sub and its seems that at least in the UK mmol is the standard. 
I think we would all benefit from greater understanding.
(FWIW, I grew up during a time when we had to know Imperial, Whitworth and Metric but its a real pain)
