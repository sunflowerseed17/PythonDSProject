I've been saving the in-game menu backgrounds for the past year and thought I'd share 4K screenshots of the latest ones.

There is also a [second variant](https://kirilltregubov.com/overbuddy/ashe_lead_rose) without the glowing particles on the gun.

Also [check out OverBuddy](https://kirilltregubov.com/overbuddy) if you want to customize your in-game menu. You can keep one of these backgrounds or choose from any of the previous ones that are still in the game files. The website also has 4K versions of the older backgrounds.
