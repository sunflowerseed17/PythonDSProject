I just came back tomthe game but I'm haven't played much still at AR12. One thing I have difficult in understanding is which chars should I focus on I have a few pulled from banners but mostly the free ones, here is a list: Xingqiu, Noelle, Sucrose, Kachina, Amber, Lisa, Kaeya, Traveller


I don't understand much about team building in the game and I know I don't have many high tier chars and I know resources here are kinda finite so I want to know how to optimize them the best.
Should I invest in any now?
Can I do a small.investment early.game in some and then starting building better chara when I get some ?
Any guides/advice on team building? Is there a base strategy like how.many dps and supports in should have?
