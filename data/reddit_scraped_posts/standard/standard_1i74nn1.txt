I'm not exactly sure what has happened, but since about yesterday (or maybe even longer), I've had trouble with League's in game servers. Every time I load in, I sit at a constant 173 ms/ping/latency/whatever you wanna call it.   
  
Now the issue here is that for months, even years, I have always sat at a constant 40-60 ping when playing League of legends. Sure, sometimes that has spiked for whatever reason, but never has it remained consistently at 173 ping. 

I've tried multiple ways to fix this (IE: updating hardware related stuff, restarting my PC, rebooting my internet, etc etc). I've even tried playing other games and they've turned out just fine! This is strictly a league issue, and I am unsure of what's going on with it.

If anyone has any info that could maybe help me troubleshoot this issue, it would be deeply appreciated. Also, I play in the Oceania server, just for some extra context.
