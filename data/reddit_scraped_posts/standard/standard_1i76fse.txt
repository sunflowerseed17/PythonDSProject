Thinking about upgrading soon. Getting nervous because 50 series is just around the corner and I don’t know if my card will lose a lot of value. 

I’d also like advice on what I should upgrade to (preferably used) for like 400-450$ price range. Should I wait to upgrade? Or will gpu prices likely stay the same.
