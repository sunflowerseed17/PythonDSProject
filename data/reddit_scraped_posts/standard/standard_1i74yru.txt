I built this little cottage house on my landscape build called the Lullaby Fjord. A regional area of my long going 10-years in the making MC World called Sky Pixel. 

The fjord is dotted by many massive tidewater glaciers. Including my glaciers "Ellieka" "Jacikah" "Harlette" "Portage" "Harlowetta" and "Kusuah" glaciers amongst others.

This region of my world is frequently overcast. So playing survival in this area has its challenges. The nearest city to the Lullaby Fjord is called Alouette. Its a small city. 

The fjord itself currently is around 7K west-east and 4K blocks north-south. Although areas are much more extensive depending on where in the fjord you are. For example. Some of the tidewater glaciers such as Jacikah extends 3K blocks north-south and 4K wide. With its origin sitting at heights of around Y-420 and extending thousands of blocks down to sea level. 

These are rough numbers. Mountainous areas vary significantly in height dependant on where you are. And much of the peaks are heavily glaciated/snowy whereas the slopes are lush with temperate evergreen forests. Much of these slopes rise dramatically from the sea level to the mountainous peaks which are evident of glaciation given the nature of the fjord. And it's northerly location in my world Sky Pixel. 

The area, as I have mentioned previously before. Is inspired by the landscapes of the Pacific Northwest where I was born and raised. This particular area is mostly centered around parts of British Columbia and Southern Alaska. 

Would you build a cottage here? And Live here despite the frequent dangerous mobs you would encounter such as grizzly bears?
