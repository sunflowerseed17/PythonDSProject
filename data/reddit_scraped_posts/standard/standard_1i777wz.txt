I'm in southeast Georgia and we're getting snow. Several times tonight I've heard a bang/hum and saw a green flash.  Some of them sounded like the electrical sound/hum when the power in your house comes back on (but louder and outside). Are those all transformers blowing or is it something else? The sound is a bit muffled due to the weather. and distance I assume. 

I have not lost power but I did see areas near me that were completely dark. 

ETA This area does not get snow often... The last time we saw any amount of snow that stayed was in 1989 I was 4 and it was Christmas. 

I'm also right next to a small local airport if that matters.
