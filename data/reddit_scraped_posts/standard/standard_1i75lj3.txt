I woke up to go to the bathroom at 3am, and my wife was dead asleep. It took me a few minutes to finish up, but nothing to long to keep her waiting forever. I switched off the light and opened the door. Now anyone who has gone to the bathroom late at night knows the difficulty to see in the near pitch blackness. I can not see a thing and she uttered some loud very short phrase, sobering like 'I need to pee' or something along those lines. I'm not someone to get scared easily, but this literally took me from an almost falling asleep on the toilet state to wide awake shout for my life. The part that pissed me off was she got mad that I shouted out of fear rather than apologize for almost making me poop again. 

Idk if anyone else has this experience, but I was a tenth of a second away from attacking, I honestly haven't been as scared as that for a very long time.
