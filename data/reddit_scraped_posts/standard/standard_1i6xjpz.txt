Hi. First of all I'm sad to be writing this, since Steam should have an easy way of doing this. 

So I have like 4 games I'm not playing atm but they are all like 20..30% downloaded. I just want to remove them from the queue. Is there no way to do this? Are my only two options-> finish downloading update or deleting the game??
