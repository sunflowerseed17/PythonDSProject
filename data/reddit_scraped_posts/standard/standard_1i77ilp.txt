Super Smash Bros is a game series that celebrates gaming as a whole, and has characters from a wast array of different genres. Yet, we don't have many FPS characters. Out of all the FPS games, i feel like Overwatch would fit the vibe of Smash the most, as the Overwatch is a lot more colorful and vibrant than say COD. So would you like Overwatch to be represented in a future Smash title?

If so, what character would you like to see playable? Also, since Super Smash Bros has Assist Trohpies, which character would you like to see as an assist trophy instead of a playable character? Which stage could be turned into a fighting stage? Lastly, is there any music you would like to appear?
