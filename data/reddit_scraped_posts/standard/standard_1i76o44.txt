Hello!

I'm playing on a server and we like to have events to keep things exciting. One of these is hide and seek. Obviously you have your closets and your trees and your piles of things, but what are some other builds I could make for hide and seek? 

Also, I wouldn't mind ideas for future events. The people are getting bored. Thank you!
