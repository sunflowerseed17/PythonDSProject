We’ve got a sliver of exposed brick beneath our front door (inside) and are wondering how to patch it. It’s definitely unwelcome as freezing temperatures set in here in Chicago lol so looking for quick fixes.

Read about liquid nails, would that plus a section of thin baseboard work? Does it need a layer of weatherstripping? Any help appreciated, ty!
