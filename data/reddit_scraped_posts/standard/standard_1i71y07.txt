Hi guys, I was watching a newer thriller the other day (not going to say what it was, but it’s likely some folks will figure it out from the context…cough blumhouse cough) and it had some of the usual tropes: the protagonist no one believes, the protagonist’s actions alienate their friends and family because their behavior seems inexplicable, etc. 

But there was a scene in the movie that if it had been done differently, could have taken the film in a whole different and unexpected direction. 

To set the scene: this is right before the climax.  The main character is desperately trying to convince her cop friend to believe her story (who the killer really is). Based on the evidence, he doesn’t believe her. Logical, of course. And the story follows a natural progression from there. We’ve seen the exact same scene played out tons of times in other movies. 

But I wondered: what if he had believed her? What if there was a beat and then he said, “Ok, I trust you. Let’s kill this guy.” And the movie went in a completely unexpected direction. 

Can you think of examples where this happens? Where the characters do something completely unexpected, but it gets you thrilled because you’re caught by surprise? Can you recommend some films for me to check out that have this effect?
