My partner (M22) has a long-term friend (F17), and they have a father-daughter type of friendship. While I respect that dynamic, something happened recently that really bothered me.

Just yesterday while I was asleep, she asked him if they could match profile pictures. My boyfriend agreed without asking me and sent me a long message, saying things like he knew I would feel uncomfortable but reassured me there were no ill intentions. At first, I didn’t know how to feel, it just seemed… weird.

I consider myself a jealous person, but only when something genuinely feels off. The idea of them matching profile pictures felt strange, especially given their age difference and our relationship. While the pictures themselves were harmless, his friend made comments like, ‘This is so us!’ which came across as a bit couple-like to me.

This led to an argument. He defended her, saying that even though she isn’t his responsibility, he feels the need to be there for her as an older brother or father figure especially because she has no parents. In the heat of the moment, I gave him an ultimatum: to choose between her or me.

Now that I’ve had time to reflect, I’m questioning whether I overreacted or if my feelings were justified. I know that it’s just profile pictures but it was also the way he defended her over understanding why I felt uncomfortable. Was I being too much? I’d really appreciate hearing your thoughts.
