Just saw a 3 minute tiktok of him talking about how because he’s rich he got a tax break, and how that shouldn’t be happening because so many people are struggling. All the right talking points. Just like the boba incident.
It’s like he sees popular talking points and just decides that’s how he’s going to win the audience over. 
Almost like he’s pandering….. to his audience….. to get more popular……. So he’s in more movies……. 
Fuckin hate actors
