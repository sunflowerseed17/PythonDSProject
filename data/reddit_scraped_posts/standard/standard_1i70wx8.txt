I'm trying to identify a tense thriller, likely from 2000-2015. Here's what I remember:

* A man is being chased for reasons unknown.
* A boy takes his father's gun, shoots someone and a bullet end up in a door, and leaves home.
* The father tries to remove a bullet from a wooden door it drops and he is using gum and his shoes to take it and hid it from the police who are present.
* There's a subplot about a girl being kidnapped, and a woman investigates. She discovers the kidnappers in a house with a toy-filled room where they exploit children for filming. she shoots all of them. 
* The setting is urban, and the tone is tense and suspenseful.
* I donâ€™t recall any notable actors or specific accents.

Does this sound familiar to anyone?

  
if you do know I would greatly appreciate it.

also the wiki did not have a section about asking for movies etc so I hope I don't intrude.
