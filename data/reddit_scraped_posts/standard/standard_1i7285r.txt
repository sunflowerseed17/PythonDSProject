I'm a new father. Me and the bm had already fallen apart at time of conception. It was a hard pill to swallow her entire pregnancy. I've accepted that i wasn't the best to her around this time. When my son was born the reality finally hit. I needed to step up. My bm has made this anything but easy. Despite the distance and hectic schedule, I make time see my son at least 1-2 weeks out of every month. I provide financial support for any and everything that she tells me he needs. I'm not there full time, I never wanted it to be that way. She doesn't know the hoops I jump thru just to bond with my son. Always threatening child support and starting arguments with me. She won't let me get my child.
Everytime I turn around I'm getting called a deadbeat, which I believe is because of my new relationship. I try but this woman keeps letting her own feelings get in the way of our coparenting and idk what to do differently.
