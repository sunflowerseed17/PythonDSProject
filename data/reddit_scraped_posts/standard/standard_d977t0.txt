 Hi all, (xpost at r/estorations)

As the title says my father passed last week. I got these photos from my aunt today, I've scanned them and put them in this folder: [Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1VbYL2HOCMocPJuz1ELNsIn5_aSqJkYvo?ths=true) (all PNG, 600dpi)

Could any of you kind folk tidy these up for me? His funeral is on Monday and I'd really appreciate it if there was at least a couple of these I could print on A4 in time for the service. (The originals are tiny!)

I'd offer money if I had any but all I can offer is my profound thanks if it can be done.
