Easily the best movie I have ever watched. I could write an entire essay about this film, that's how good it is. As of right now I know nothing of how the film was supposed to be interpreted or genuine facts about the film, so everything I say will be of my own accord and interpretation. One of these interpretations that I wanted to shed light on is that only two of the men wear glasses (eyeglasses). Which characters wear them and why does this matter? Its certainly not a coincidence that the two characters who have careers in finance need glasses. One is a stock broker and the other is a salesmen. Both very capitalistic and materialistic heavy career paths. In my opinion the film makers are trying to get philosophical by saying that these career paths are clouding ones vision (which is my they need glasses). Their judgement is clouded by their focus on making money and material gain, with no care about anything else. Davis who is an architect and who sees the world clearly, doesn't care about material gain or money. He values family as the upmost important thing in his life. I understand why a lot of schools teach using this film. I want to talk about Platonism and how it is also heavily referenced to in this film but I need to go eat lmao. I very interested to know what you guys think!

EDIT: Grammar.
