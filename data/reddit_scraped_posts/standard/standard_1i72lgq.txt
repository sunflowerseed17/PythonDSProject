Title- they never showed zoans really aside from jailer beasts that let their mind get taken over. What if imu is actually someone good, with the immortal youth but got a mythical zoan god fruit like luffy, but they didn’t have the will to overcome it? Thoughts??- think the white transform red eyes though Imu has double ringed eyes and a transformation. Maybe the god of whatever is actually the incarnation and Imu is Lilly but Lilly died when the god zoan took over. ???? I’m hates nika?- moon princess hiyori-> foreshadowing the moon god maybe mu? What if the gomu fruit actually got sent in  time by toki before meeting oden? She would be that who weaved history for the sovereigns to rule once again, only Imu needs to die so vividly gets the fruit ? Maybe that’s why Dofi wanted ope ope fruit to swap in to Imu to rule…thoughts????
