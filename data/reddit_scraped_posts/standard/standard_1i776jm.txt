My(18f) friend John(18m) confessed to me two months ago but I rejected him. He took it respectfully; did not try to pressure me into changing my mind or anything. Just continued to be my friend and hang out with me.

Last week, my new friend Violet(18) told me she likes John. I’ve known John for much longer than she has so she asked me about his interests, wanting something to talk to him about. I still feel bad about breaking his heart and thought he might be able to move on with her ; we have similar personalities and physical appearances so I can see him falling for Violet.

So I gave her lists of his favorite authors, novels, animes and songs.

At first it seemed to work. But then he got curious at how much they had in common, with her ‘liking’ a lot of the stuff he does. He made a comment about this when we were having lunch together yesterday.

I got nervous and fidgeted. He noticed this. Asked me what’s wrong. I broke down and told him what he did. He said ‘I know you don’t want me but do you have to give me away to someone else?’

It stung because it did kind of describe what I did and sounded kind of messed up when put that way.
