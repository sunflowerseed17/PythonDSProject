Hi,

I live in the Florida Panhandle where we are experiencing unexpected low temps. The big problem we are facing is our water pipes freezing. Last night was in mid-20's (with windchill) and today it's expected to get into the teens (for an extended period of time).

I'm not so concerned about the indoor pipes: even though I didn't insulate the main water pipe that goes into the house (and is exposed in the crawlspace below the house), I think running the indoor faucets with the heat on high will probably be okay.

My main concern are my 2 outdoor faucets. One comes from the house and the other comes from the well (part of which is above ground). I wrapped the well assembly above ground and insulated it pretty well and then I ran both faucets last night and everything seems okay. I planned on doing the same today and monitoring them and if they started to freeze go ahead and use a hair dryer to keep them warm. A friend of mine says though that when the temperatures get into the teens running the outside faucets won't work and instead I need to try to insulate them as best I can by wrapping them in foam what other insulating materials I can find and then covering them with some sort of styrofoam.

Wondering what everyone else thinks. Just bought this home and really can't afford to pay for busted pipes if you know what I mean. Appreciate any advice you may have
