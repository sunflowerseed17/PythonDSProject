Hi - We bought a new construction home and I just noticed a slight draft coming in from our brand new windows in the living room. The air is coming in where you can see there's a slight crack at the edge of the window. It's almost like the window wasn't quite fitted right. Can someone with experience in this topic let me know if this is normal ?
