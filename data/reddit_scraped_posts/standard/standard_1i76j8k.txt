How would you customize this PC to optimize its potential for gaming, audio and video production, and streaming? Budget options and expensive options welcome. Looking to make some additions/part swaps in the forseeable future just want a great PC. I'll be honest, I'm not experienced building PCs and don't really know what I'm talking about :) please help!
