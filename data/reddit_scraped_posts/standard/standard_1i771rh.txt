I need more USB type A and USB type C ports in my desktop. As I'm going to block a whole slot, preferably "as many as possible". 

I've seen some products that look okay. However the cards look offbrand-ish and I wonder if there are some things I need to know. Like maybe there are some good and bad controllers? Or maybe there are some chips I need to look for?
