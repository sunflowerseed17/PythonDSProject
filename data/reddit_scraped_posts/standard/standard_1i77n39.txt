A couple nights ago Elon Musk gave a speech where he punctuated his enthusiasm with a Zeig Heil. It was a weird spasm that reminded me of the ending of Doctor Strangelove. 

Anyway, Musk is getting a lot of negative attention for this, which is upsetting his loyal fans. They're responding that it wasn't a Zeig Heil at all, and it's also fine because  many people they don't like have waved or pointed at things.

Some examples:

Have these people never waved or pointed before? Why can't they see the difference between a video of a Zeig Heil and a still photo of someone pointing or waving hello. Do they understand that it's probably inappropriate to Zeig Heil America because American GIs fought against Nazis in that second war (sorry I can't remember the name of it). It's pretty weird that they don't know about all that. So what's the deal?
