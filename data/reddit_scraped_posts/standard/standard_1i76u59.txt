What mods do you guys know that basically take a game and turn it into a sequel to itself? 

I've been playing a bunch of FTL: Multiverse. It's basically that. While adding a ton of content, probably more than tripling the amount of content from base FTL, the mod also takes place after the events of the original. It's the closest thing we have to an actual sequel to FTL, and it is great. Highly recommended. 

I wonder if there are more mods like it? 

I've heard people saying Slay the Spire: Downfall is sort of like it. I've played it a bit, but honestly prefer base Slay the Spire. I also don't really know if you can call it a sequel... Slay the Spire doesn't have much of a story. Downfall doesn't take place after Slay the Spire... Not that a sequel needs to take place chronologically after the thing it's based on.
