Title: ÅITAH for cutting off my boyfriend and leaving him after I’ve asked him too many times to help me clean the house we’re leaving, as it’s not just me using it?

So, I have been with my boyfriend for about two years now. We’ve been living together for the past year in an apartment that we’re about to move out of. It’s been a stressful time as we’re both juggling work, and I’ve been trying to pack up our things while keeping the apartment in some kind of shape.

The problem is, I’ve asked him multiple times to help me clean and keep the place together. It’s not like it’s just my mess. It’s both of us using the space, and we both agreed that we should keep it in good condition before moving out. But every time I ask, he either brushes it off, makes excuses, or says he’s too tired. I’ve had to pick up most of the slack, and it’s becoming overwhelming. I’ve even tried to be patient, suggesting simple ways to split tasks, but he’s been really uncooperative.

I’ve reached a point where I’ve had to ask him multiple times, and he still doesn’t help. I’ve told him how frustrated I am, but it hasn’t changed. So, after another argument where he refused to help, I decided to cut ties and left him. I’m just exhausted from carrying all the responsibility in the relationship, and I don’t want to feel like I’m doing everything alone anymore.

Now, I’m second-guessing my decision. I feel like I might have been too quick to leave, but at the same time, I feel like I’ve been asking for basic respect and teamwork for so long and not getting it.

AITA for cutting him off over this?
