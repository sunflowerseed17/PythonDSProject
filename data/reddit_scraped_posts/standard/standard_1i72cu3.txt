Let's say Joker stays with the Nuggets for the rest of his career, never plays with an all star, and fails to win another ring. However, he ends his career with the highest offensive BPM and the highest defensive BPM of all time.

For context, he is currently #1 all time in OBPM and #3 in DBPM (would move to #1 by adding only 0.11 points).

In this scenario, are we incentivized to split the goat conversation into goat and boat? Because while someone like Bill Russell has 11 rings to Joker's 1, advanced stats paint an inverse picture when it comes to the two players' comparitive basketball ability.
