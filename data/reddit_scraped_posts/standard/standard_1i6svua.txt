Hey,
I’ve got this old map here that my mom brought home from her school (she’s a teacher). It’s probably been chilling in the school’s map collection for quite a while. It’s from 1951 and shows the borders of the German Reich as they were in 1937. Honestly, I find the political implications of this map pretty problematic, but at the same time, I think the map itself is really beautiful. What do you guys think – is it okay to hang it up?
