Hello r/excel,I get a list of addresses every month in the formatted in the way shown in the picture - tab Sheet 1 - I'm trying to find ways to clean up the data so I end up with the result in Sheet 3 (at the bottom on the pic)Sheet 2 is where I am at just now and I am looking for some helpful advice/tips to sort this out. I added some comments about process and goals on the Sheet 2 part in the pic.

Can anyone give me some ideas please?
