... in games that offer these hidden collectibles and caches, do you try to collect all of them before leaving a zone or do you just play the story and come back afterwards to fade out your time with the game?

Also, if you try to complete the zones first, how do you go about collectibles that are hidden behind tools that you only get later in the game. Do you try to remember and go back as soon as you get the necessary tools or do you first complete the game?

Especially the latter situation sometimes stresses me out because I'm afraid of forgetting a place to later check back again.
