So I have been buying up a decent position in MARA for the past couple of weeks. So why mara over mstr?

MSTR has quite high premiums on the option chain, so the roi will be lower in comparison with MARA. 

Why i am I so bullish on MARA? Because they have a really innovative way to mine bitcoin. They go to places that have excess energy and use that energy to mine bitcoin at a really low price. They started using the mstr approach, buying btc with capital.

They mine and average of 28.7 BTC each day and have a total of 44,893 BTC (on 12/31/24). The amount of btc they have is the largest of any BTC mining company. 

The shares of MARA reached a high of 83.45 usd in the 2021 bull cycle of btc. And my guess is this cycle they will go even higher, worst case I see them hit 50 usd this year. Which is a 250% gain!

Now what are my positions. I have 2 strategies on MARA going at the moment, leap calls and leap debit spreads. The leap debit spreads are front heavy with the strikes of 40 and 47, I have 250 of them which will result in about 150,000 usd or a 1000% gain. These i will close when MARA gets above 50. My long calls are at the 30 strike price. Which I will sell poor man's covered calls on in the meantime for extra income. The leap calls and leap debit spreads expire 16 Jan 2026

In my opinion this is a solid play, but I am open for feedback if you have any.
