So I (19 f) and my boyfriend (20m) have been dating for a little over a year and it’s been alright so far. My only issue is that he always wants to have sex and it throws me off a bit. I don’t have a very high sex drive and he does, I’m not sure if it’s a me thing or if it’s the fact that he just can’t make me finish but it just makes me feel gross that I feel lusted over more than I feel loved and I don’t know how to bring it up to him correctly because I don’t want to stop having sex all together just not every day. Even when I make it clear that I’m not in the mood he keeps asking for it until I eventually give in and it’s gotten to a point that I don’t know if I even want to be with him anymore because of it.
