From the day I started paying my own rent / taxes / EveryOtherFeeThatSteals30%, I became very pessimistic that moving out of your 'class' is not really possible. When you have money, it is incredibly easier to make more money. If you have an uncle who works at NASA, you will have an astronomically better chances of getting a job at NASA. If you have 100k to throw into the stock market, it will provide more returns than the interest you pay on your AMex card. But if you grew up middle class, paying for your own education, or not getting a degree at all, how likely is it you will break out of that statistically-depressing mold? 

I was fortunate enough to dodge the college route working in IT, while still making more than my parents. But I am now old enough where I need to take care of my remaining parent and the thought of planning a trip to Iceland seems unattainable financially. I clearly recognize I will never be in the top 10% in the US, but coming from a middle class family 20 years ago (born '94), with no real upper-hand, can you realistically expect to 'be better than your parents' with the all the 'once in a lifetime events' happening recently??
