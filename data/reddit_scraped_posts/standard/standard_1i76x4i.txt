Alright, I need advice on this because it’s been bugging me for a while. My Geography teacher insists that Australia is the continent and dismissed Oceania altogether. I understand Australia is a continent in itself, but isn’t Oceania the modern and more widely accepted term for the region that includes Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific Islands like Fiji and Tuvalu?

When I tried to bring up Oceania, my teacher dismissed it, saying that ‘we were taught it was Australia, and that’s how it is.’ But it feels like we’re ignoring the broader geographical understanding of the region. I tried making the point that it doesn’t make sense for New Zealand or Fiji to be considered part of Australia, but my teacher just wouldn’t listen.

So, am I wrong for thinking that this outdated view is not accurate? Should I just let it go or keep pushing back for a more modern understanding? I’m looking for advice on how to handle this situation and maybe any resources I could use to better explain the difference.
