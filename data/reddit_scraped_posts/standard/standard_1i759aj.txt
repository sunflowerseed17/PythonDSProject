They’re both different movies, the only thing they have in common it’s the year and that they are starred by Natalie Portman. I think that besides Black swan this are her best movies and they were on the best time of her career.

Closer was an awarded movie with multiple nominations including an Oscar nom. And Garden state was way more than a romantic comedy. It has romance but it has so many more elements. I just hated that the end felt like a romantic comedy cliche.

I think that even if Closer it’s better Garden state it’s way more rewatchable and the characters were more likeable.

What about you guys? What are your thoughts on this movies and which one it’s your favorite?
