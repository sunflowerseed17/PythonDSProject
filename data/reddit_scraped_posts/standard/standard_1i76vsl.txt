Alright, I need to get this off my chest because I don’t know what to think anymore. My wife, Martha, has been acting... strange. I’ve woken up at night more times than I can count, and there she is, sitting in a corner, reading these strange books. I’ve tried asking her about them, but she won’t tell me a thing. She just hides them.

Here’s where it gets weirder. Last night, I was trying to say my prayers, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t. It was like something was blocking me. Then she just closes her book, walks out of the house, and suddenly—I could pray again! What do you make of that?

I’m not saying she’s in league with the Devil, but this whole situation is unsettling. What kind of books is she reading, and why is she keeping them a secret? Could it mean something... darker? Anyone else ever deal with something like this?
