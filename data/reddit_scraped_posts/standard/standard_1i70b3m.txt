Just trying to learn... was in a norms game, and someone started the FF vote, it went 3yes/1no, and 1 empty in the animation... nobody appeared afk through the match... but the game ended with the message "vote successful with 3 votes yes"... did this change this season?

Edit: Just played a game where the message box said enemy team FF'd with 2 votes... I clearly missed something... just asking for someone to catch me up now

Edit 2: ok, now I think there's something very sus happening because I play solo queu and we just went ff'd with 4-0 and the ff option never even popped up... and I even saved/watched the replay... wtf is going on... 3 games in a row.

  
Edit 3.... I'm calling sus, I was just chillin in a game and I suddenly saw the " you ff'd with 4-0"... I'm calling absolute bs
