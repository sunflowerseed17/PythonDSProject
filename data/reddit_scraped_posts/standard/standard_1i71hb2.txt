I recently started playing again, havent played since launch.  I heard about Yakumo giving traits to pals you capture so I have been farming Jetragon with this maxed out Yakumo and I have yet to get the 2 traits.  It seems to always get infinite stamina but I have only ever gotten 2 with swift and they are both the wrong gender for breeding.  My question is, should I just continue capturing in hopes both traits will stick eventually or should I breed a maxed out Yakumo with only swift and try to get a Jetragon with that to breed that with a infinite stam.  Another worry is that 95% of my captures have been male so even if I start getting swifts I will have to grind forever to get a breeding combo.  I am 70+ captures deep so I would like to get one soon, also no rocket schematic yet either!
