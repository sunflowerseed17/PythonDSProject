The backflow preventer on our irrigation system broke today and I’m looking for help determining if this was intentional or if it broke on its own. Around 1:30pm I was working from home and heard someone at the front door making some noises. I didn’t think anything about it since we regularly get mail delivered to our front door. 

Around 2pm I went to get a glass of water from the kitchen and we didn’t have any water pressure. I then noticed a sound coming from the front of the house, opened the front door, and found our backflow preventer gushing water all over our front porch. I took the backflow preventer insulated cover (not pictured) off, and tried to hastily reconnect the pipes but it didn’t work. I went into the crawlspace and turned off the water main line which stopped the leak.

Now, I need some help figuring out what happened. As mentioned I have an insulated backflow cover. Temps have been very cold and recently warmed up - the low temperature this morning was -3F and it is currently sunny and 40F. It was even colder over the weekend. Could this temperature swing cause the fitting in the image to fail on its own?

I have three outdoor security cameras but unfortunately none of them saved the recording during the time when it broke. I do see footprints going directly to the backflow and clearly heard someone doing something out front. My car is in the driveway and whoever was there didn’t knock on the door or ring the doorbell. 

Any help would be appreciated…
