I've started a podcast on a very limited budget and need some advice about audio at time of recording. It's a conversation style podcast with two people. There is no room for spending more money on gear. The issue I am having is that my co-host is naturally quietly spoken where my voice is deeper and projects more (used to work as a tour guide). The first couple of episodes were recorded on a Zoom H1N, ep1 with no mics, ep2 with 2 lavs on a splitter. When I import into Audacity (can't afford paid like Au or Garage Band) my colleagues speech waveforms are very low, but mine tend to blow out (even having my mic further away), which is taking me hours to edit and I'm still not getting enough boost on my colleague or reduction on mine.  
Circumstances mean we can't have a permanent set up, so are restricted to what I can set up quickly eg H1N or laptop, plugin mics & hit record. Does anyone have any advice for something like a digital mixer which would work with the two lavs or some mystery setting I can use in Audacity to set mic levels before recording? Both lavs are picking up both our voices, and there's no way of isolating and I've watched several audacity vids, but none have shown how to handle different levels. If important, lavs are same make, AGPTEK.  
I'm using u/buzzsprout as the host, (we haven't started to upload, first 2 are on youtube as tests) they have magic mastering but we can't even shell out for that just now, and I'm not entirely sure that would be the solution.
