Feasgar math!
I'm getting translation for country names and am having a bit of a problem with some of them. I'm still a basic learner.
Most start with A or An, but I've seen others, specifically Nirribhidh (Norway - Ive also seen Lochlann) which I expected to be An Nirribhidh, Slobhinia (Slovenia) which I expected to be An t-Slobhinia (similarly with Slobhagia).
Can someone explain why the differences and what you would regard as correct?
MÃ²ran taing!
