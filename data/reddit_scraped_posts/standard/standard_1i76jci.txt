I am hoping that my old-school peeps (maybe new-school as well) can help me with my obscure quest.

I am looking for an obscure shooter/strategy game.

I think (this is not a definite guide) that this game came from the late 90's or early 2000's.

I'm pretty sure that the setting was WW2 but it's defining feature was that you controlled a collection of (I think) 4 soldiers in real time (only one at a time). You would have real time control of one soldier but when you were done with them you could swap to another in the squad. All soldiers were on the same map wherever you left them. If I remember right, uncontrolled characters had limited bot control.

My googling/gpt'ing has come up blank but I know you hoomans will win the game.

Thanks to all of you.
