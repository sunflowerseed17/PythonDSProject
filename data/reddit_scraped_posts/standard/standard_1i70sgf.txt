I've sailing the seas since long time. When I started 10-15 years back, I was in an Asian country, when it was all about just installing uTorrent and downloading whatever you want. No need of VPNs.

Now I am in Canada, using SaskTel as my ISP. I bought Proton VPN Plus. Connect to Asian servers and always using Kill Switch feature of the VPN. Using qBittorrent. Bound VPN with it.

Am I taking enough steps for safe torrenting?
