Howdy,

In the cold of NH, and we have encountered our second frozen pipe issue. First time this happened a few weeks ago, it cleared itself up and no leaks could be found. Now it’s here again but the cold isn’t gonna go away so we’ve gotta figure this out.

We live in a mobile home that is placed on a slab. The piping from the well to the well tank is all insulated well, with electric pipe heaters all over the place. We have no running water to half of our house, and normal running water to the other half. One thing that I have linked to also being on the half of the house that has no running water is that the spigot outside is on that side of the house, and feels as if though it’s frozen solid (can’t loosen or tighten it) when I know it worked properly a weak ago. 

All of the pipes that run water through the house are difficult to get to, as they run directly into the insulation that runs under the house after leaving the well tank. It a vinyl sided house with vinyl skirting, so I can get under it easily, but the pipes are just hard to find/follow. 

Does anyone have experience with these spigots and think this could be the issue?

Thanks for any help
