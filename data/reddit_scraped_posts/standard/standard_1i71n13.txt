I was so far ahead of my kid and then end up like this and couldn't move! Had to sit there for 10 minutes watching my kid move all his pieces home. For those unfamiliar with the game, in the game Trouble, rolling a 1 doesn't allow you to move, so you have to hope another player lands on your piece sends you home so you can try to get out from home and go all the way around the board again.
