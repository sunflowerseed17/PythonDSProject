Definition of tp: (especially in science fiction) transport or be transported across space and distance *_instantly_*

Is new tp instant? Far from it. Just because I transform into Kennen E and move at quadruple of Quinn’s move speed doesn’t make me teleport. Sure, make a channel or something, that makes sense, but call it teleport when I’m just running really fast to my tower? Just call it warp or something, but dont call it something that just isn’t true. Literally unplayable.
