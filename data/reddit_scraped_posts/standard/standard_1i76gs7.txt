I was doing a group project at uni, and when I first met my professor I didn’t know she was pregnant. Later, when she started wearing maternity clothes, I thought to myself “oh maybe she’s pregnant”. But that was it, I didn’t know anything else about her pregnancy.

Fast forward to last month, she got a cold. After about 3 weeks later, that’s when we first heard from her again since she was sick. This is when my group decided to schedule an online meeting with her to update her our progress. So we all attended the meeting, and towards the end I asked her if she could read our research paper and give some feedback. At this point we still have 3 weeks before the deadline, so I figured it was okay to request that. She replied back saying that depends cos she’s having a baby in 5 days, which I did not know about. But I totally understood and thanked her for considering, I also said it’s totally okay that she can’t. We then ended the call after wishing her health on her maternity leave.

The whole thing feels completely normal to me. But the next day, my team and I met in person, and one of my teammate started calling me out in front of everyone. She said “I need to tell you something before I forget, you were so rude when you ask the professor to read our paper when she’s due in a few days, please never do that again”.

I’m very confused as to where I did wrong so AITAH in this?
