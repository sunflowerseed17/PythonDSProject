Many people are upset by todayâ€™s landmark behavior of Meta, and this is of course part of a longer term dissatisfaction with privacy, moderation, censorship, and general ethics with the major social media companies, namely The Platform Formerly Known as Twitter, Meta, and TikTok. 
  
It appears that many people are flocking to BlueSky. What about BlueSky sets it apart, ethically, from the other notorious platforms? Why should I trust it more, or less, than its competitors?
