It’s quite drafty from behind/underneath kitchen cabinets. Unfortunately, I can’t remove the kick board as it’s been nailed directly into the bottom of the cabinets (from above).

Absent removing all of the cabinets, could I do one of the following (and which is better)?

Spray foam behind it (I’m not sure how far in I could get)
Stuff insulation behind it (through the gap) to try and seal it.

Any other thoughts/upsides/downsides?
