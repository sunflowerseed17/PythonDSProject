Hello, I mainly focused on an SH romance with a good Durge, and there at the end of act 2 I can become Minthara's lover and SH tells me "I have nothing against it but I had to talk " 
I have just entered act 3 and my questions are: is the romance with Minthara successful and relevant compared to SH in act 3 (knowing that Minthara promised me a night that never happened) 
Is she definitely dead with SH or after a few rests she will want to return to Popol's arms? 
Thank you friends, enjoy the game!
