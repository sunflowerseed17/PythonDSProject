As a Lakers and Dodgers fan myself, it's interesting looking at the two teams and the trajectory they're heading, with the former heading toward an unknown future while the latter only seems to be just getting started (we'll see what they ultimately make of it in a decade from now when it's all said and done).

BTW, as of now, are the Lakers still the most despised LA sports team or have the Dodgers taken that title for the time being?
