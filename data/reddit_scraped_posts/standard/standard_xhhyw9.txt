I've watched with growing anger at the total re writing of history around the Monarchy and the suppression of free speech that has come hand in hand with it since the death of Elizabeth Saxe-Coburg-Gotha-Battenburg.
I'm going to put a blank piece of white paper in my window tomorrow. Any one else want to do the same? They can't arrest us all for dissent.
