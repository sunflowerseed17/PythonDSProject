Herta (or The Herta or Madam Herta) is a character defined by her unending thirst for knowledge and improvement. Her dedication to improve herself through the acquisition of knowledge has granted her a power nearing godhood. Yet, isn't it ironic that the one who created a character who strives for self-improvement is the antithesis to that? Boring and bloated dialogue, corporate greed, blatant ignorance of the fans' feedback requesting QOL for years. Does this not encapsulate the idea of complacency? The absolute irony of a complacent company creating a character who strives for nothing but improvement and knowledge is just too peak for me.
