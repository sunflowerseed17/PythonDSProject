My baby has had a cold for several weeks and has been passing it back and forth with the child we have a nanny share with. Both babies have had colds over the past couple of weeks. My baby is immunocompromised right now and we want them to recover.  The other baby’s cough is worse than our baby’s cough. AITAH for asking the other family to keep their child home instead of keeping my baby home?
