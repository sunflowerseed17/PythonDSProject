If you check the "hidden replies" tab, most of the comments are flooded with specifically transgender related stuff that my brain isn't orientated enough to comprehend all of LGBTQ+ things. I'm no longer into Pixar and its community since I am a grown man so I don't watch any movie for children. Can anyone explain as much as possible to completely understand the context?

Edit: I asked becuase I thought Disney is LGBTQ+ friendly but they're so happened to remove a transgender character.
