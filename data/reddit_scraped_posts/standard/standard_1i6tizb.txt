Firstly, I’ve seen over 2000 movies and many horrific horror films. But I rarely get the chance to see the super crazy ones in theaters since my theater doesn’t usually screen things like Climax or Oddity. Just curious if it’s REALLY as anxiety inducing as it is said to be or if it’s just advertisement BS along the lines of Longlegs which was portrayed to be the most horrific thing ever and wasn’t even in the top five scariest movies of last year to me
