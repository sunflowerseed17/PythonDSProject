Hi everyone

I just started my subscription on NBA League Pass, but since I live in europe i barely can see any game live. 

My question for my fellow europeans, how do you manage to watch the games? What I’ve been doing for the past days is to check the option “no spoilers” and watch the second day. 

I am just curious how do you watch games in general
