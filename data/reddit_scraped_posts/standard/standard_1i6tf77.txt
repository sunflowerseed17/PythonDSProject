I'm not even sure how to phrase the question. There were so many points that confused me it was insane. I would love for somebody to explain these to me.

How did Lazzaro time travel? His family was way too casual about that.
Also, why did Lazzaro time travel? What was the point of that from the writer's perspective? What did they want to achieve there? 

What was the music leaving the church and following his family supposed to mean? How did that happen? Also, why are there two of him? Because wasn't he also the organ player in the church?

What was the ending all about? I feel like it stopped right in the middle of the movie. What was the point of any of that?

I'm studying it for school and they want an analysis of it. I don't even know where to start. Please help.
