Completely out of the loop on this one. What's with the weeks long drama about the streamer/game dev PirateSoftware? Every day there seems to be fifty clips and takes on his takes like this [https://www.twitch.tv/albinovevo/clip/HomelyExcitedEggChocolateRain--vi3yMv8J996yePK](https://www.twitch.tv/albinovevo/clip/HomelyExcitedEggChocolateRain--vi3yMv8J996yePK) inÂ [r/LivestreamFail](https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/), and all the comments are just shitting on PirateSoftware with really no explanation on what started all this.
