Currently StrawHats & Co defeated Emperors and then this guy shows up!

First of all Zoro and Sanji Kicked King and Queen out of the flying Onigashima and they bith were severely injured and even after falling from that high how tf they were still alive?

Now coming on Ryokugyu I know he is admiral and creators wanted him to look more bad ass but bro like he just defeated beast pirates in less than one minute? While both King and Queen were present there, If they wanted to make him look badass they could've just showed the process of how he captured sabo in Merijois.

Similar kind of thing happened in Dressrossa arc, like how the hell Fujitora wasn't able brake that cage of Doflamingo????
