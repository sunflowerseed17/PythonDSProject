So one of my Friends plays like a lot of League. He convinced me to watch Arcane and I loved it rly much! His birthday is coming up and i wanted to surprise him. He told me a few weeks back that he would love to buy the  Savior Viktor and Survivor Jayce Skins but he doesnt have the money rn so i thaught i'll buy him those skins. Now i reqd somewhere that those skins are limited time only or smth? Can smby explain to me how the league Shop works or if he can even still get those skins. I only play Valorant so i dont know how the Shop system works in league. Thx in advance!
