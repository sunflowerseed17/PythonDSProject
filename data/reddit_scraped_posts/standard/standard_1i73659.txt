Okay so I know what I’m about to say it’s a stretch, but I noticed it shortly after I (FINALLY) got mavuika

Each archon has something integral to their kit, and it goes as follows:

Venti: Artifact set

Zhongli: Hp

Raiden: Energy Recharge

Nahida: Elemental mastery

Furina: Healing

Mavuika: Attack

Following this, wouldn’t it make sense if the Tsaritsa scaled off defense in some way? It’s the only stat/effect that can be properly built around and has yet to have an archon centered around it

Plus, off topic but another thing I kinda noticed while typing this is the fact there seems to be a repeating pattern of three, and following the idea we could gain access to two more elements in the future could complete the pattern with archons, going as such:

1st: Element mastery scaling

2nd: HP scaling

3rd: Attack scaling

Which following this pattern again, that means somehow the Tsaritsa could scale off EM in some capacity

Just thought I’d say this and see if anyone else noticed, or if it’s just a neat little fact I picked up on. Tell me your opinions if you can, or if I maybe overlooked something in my theory :3
