In the process of building this wet bar. 144” wide of counter space. (tapers to 12” wide on the left side to accommodate the door)


Right now I have a green tape outline of the would be drop in sink size. 25” x 22”. 

The outside of the tape line simulates where the outside edges of the drop in sink lip would sit. So the actual hole will be a good amount smaller.  So no worries of counter integrity. (that tape should be centered on those cabinet doors)


 I feel like this size complements the space. But I want to avoid this feeling like a second kitchen lol….

Thoughts? Should I go with the more traditional 16”x20” bar sink?
