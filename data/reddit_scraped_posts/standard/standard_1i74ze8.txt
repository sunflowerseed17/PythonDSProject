He finished with 3-3 from 3, 4-4 from the FT line, 3 assists and 1 TO. Uncharacteristically, no rebounds from him.

First player off the bench. He's been the bench's stabilizing factor. This wasn't even Malone's idea. Malone was forced to do bring AG off the bench because AG got injured and is on minutes restriction. For so long, Malone has been unable to find a solution to the non-Jokic minutes. Playing at least 2 starters when the no. 1 player is resting is basically what most good coaches are doing. (Murray plays with the bench in the off Jokic minutes usually).

It's amazing to see AG's improvement in shooting this season. He's got season highs in 3pt % and FT%. He has added a turn around fade away shot that is surprisingly consistent.
