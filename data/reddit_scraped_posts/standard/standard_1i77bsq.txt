In these modern times, there are cameras, social media, CCTV footage, superior  technology and forensic techniques are just so much more advanced. It would be close to impossible for people today to get away with murder. You'd have to be incredibly careful, get rid of every slither of evidence and plan everything to a T. 

Back in the 17th century or so, it must've been so easy. All you'd have to worry about are actual eye-witnesses. It must've been incredibly easy to just shank someone in private and get away with it.
