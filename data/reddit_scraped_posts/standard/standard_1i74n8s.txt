Hullo! My sister and I recently got into a debate over whether or not Feixiao has a house upon the Luofu, given the animation, "Taking It Easy". There are many things I would like to point out. 

One: 
The abundance of makeup in the bathroom, clearly meant for Feixiao. She's not one to travel heavy, and why would she bring all that makeup if she's traveling? 

Two: 
There is a treadmill in an area of the house, perhaps the living room, clearly for her needs. 

Three:
She eats a healthy meal at the table, and yes, she could have gotten takeout, but it looks like she made the food herself 

Four: 
Her bedroom looked like it clearly matched her apparel and her style. Not to mention the interior decor of the house.

Does she have a separate house at the Luofu? Or did we see her house?
