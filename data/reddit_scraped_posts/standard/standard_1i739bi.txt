I’ve changed the meteorite/supply drop interval to 1 and have been trying to get a legendary armor to drop from it but the only high tier item I’ve gotten is a epic grenade launcher like 5 times is it bugged or something or has someone gotten a legendary schematic to drop from it and yes I’m doing them in the new island
