I was never good at having a friend when I was a kid (I still don’t) so I just played Minecraft a lot I remember feeling so lonely that I put armor stands to make it seem like it was a player and then I watch videos on how to make an armor stand follow u I never knew how to and I still don’t idk it was kinda funny now that I think about it
