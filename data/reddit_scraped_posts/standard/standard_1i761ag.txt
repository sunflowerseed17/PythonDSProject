I’ve been seeing so much about these fancy jobs in corporate offices (especially at game development places) that have “game rooms” or gyms or something extracurricular… why? Aren’t you only there to work ? You can’t just go work out during your job. Or like, go play pool games?? Or video games? Am I confused and at these jobs you can or is it something they expect people to stay after work to do. Or on their hour break? So weird to me!! For context, I’ve only ever worked at retail or ER jobs so the world of corporate offices is foreign to me.
