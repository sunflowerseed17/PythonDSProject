Started my 2nd playthrough, still in act 1 lv 5, and already there are so many things I missed the first time. (Spoilers) Using the 3 trolls was loads of fun, seeing Laezel naked was HAIR RAISING, killing aunty Ethel in her hut WITHOUT explosive barrels, killing Ragzlin AND his minions with one shot from the rafters, priceless. I also just installed 2 mods, one for triple XP, and one for 130 extra spells. Not interested in cosmetic mods, which console mod would you reccomend?
