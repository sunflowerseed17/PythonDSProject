I recently watched Get Smart (2008) remembering how much I loved it as a preteen and thought it was one of the funniest movies I’d ever seen. On rewatch I was disappointed that I didn’t laugh once and cringed through most of it. 

I don’t think it’s the movie’s fault, the almost-but-not-quite meta humor where a character in an action movie makes silly or relatable comments hadn’t been overdone by Marvel movies at that point, but now in 2025 it just seems overdone and awkward.

Has anyone else had this experience?
