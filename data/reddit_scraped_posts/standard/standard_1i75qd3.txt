|ram|(2x) Crucial 8GB DDR5-5600 UDIMM Desktop Memory|Someone say about heatsink problem, but idk whats that. Also is it good to just buy a single 16gb ram or 2 ram for dual channel?|
|gpu|Colorful GeForce RTX 3060 NB DUO 12G V2 L-V Video Card|i need nvdia for 3d, & i think this is best gpu that's not 8 vram|
|ssd|MSI Spatium M450 1TB PCIE 4.0 NVME M.2 SSD Solid State Drive|is pcie4 worth it for performance? someone recommend me Lexar NM610 Pro, but it's pcie3, so ur thoughts? also recommend if there's better storage capacity.|
|psu|FSP HV PRO 85+ 650W Bronze Power Supply Unit|is 550w enough? also is this good product, im scared about psu. someone recommend MSI MAG A550BN/A650BN 80+ 650w bronze|

|case fans|(6x) Inplay ICE Tower Case Fan Dual Sync Mode 6 Pin ARGB 120MM 41CFM With Hub Remote Control|is 6 fans overkill? i dont know. Also if bad, pls recommend|
|monitor|AOC 24B30H2/BW 23.8″ 1920 × 1080 FHD IPS 1MS 120Hz White Monitor|im not sure 1080 or 1440 for artist? Also hz is fine as long as 60+, but max capable of performance is welcome.|

I've been saving my whole life, this is my first pc, and for college so pls help. I'm mostly into performance but aesthetic is welcome. Idk what is a heatsink & vrm. My main problems on deciding are cpu, mobo, psu, & monitor, help. Also, windows 10 or 11? can i also do that without paying? Btw I'm from Philippines (₱). Thank you so much this means a lot
