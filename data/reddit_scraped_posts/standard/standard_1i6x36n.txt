Hi.. the hallway to my flat/apartment has these horrible foam style tiles because above them is where the unit and ducting for the heating system is located.

I've seen a few different things but would love if someone had a suggestion on how I can make this room more attractive/ less like an office. There would still need to be access to get at the heating unit to service it.

Thanks

(I've tried to paint them a bit white but I think maybe looks worse ((the 3rd photo are the ones in the communal corridor)).
