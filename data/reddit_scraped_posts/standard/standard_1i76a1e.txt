 Hello everyone, I’m working on a concept for a service that tracks household electricity consumption in the US. The idea is to show real-time usage, its environmental impact, and provide insights. In France, we have standardized smart meters for this—do similar systems exist in the US, where i could take the data from :)

This is a fictional project, I would just like to see if the idea could work ! 

Thanks a lot !
