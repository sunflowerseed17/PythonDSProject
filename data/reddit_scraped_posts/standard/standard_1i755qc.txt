It has been a blast to join the Super Earth Taxi Service in the last few weeks and help spread democracy by delivering payloads of 1-3 Helldivers to their desired locations at maximum speed and only minimal occurrences of unintended roll overs, catastrophic crashes, explosions, sudden Helldiver life loss, critical vehicular malfunctions, spider infestations, alien spider infestations, harvester laser incidents, sudden tree root epidemics, sudden rock epidemics, lost tyres, lost driver, incidental incindiairy episodes and other such annoyances. 

All this said, we of SETS do wish that our Helldiver travellers please remember to give a review after their trip as it does affect the morale of the Helldrivers when things go undemocractically wrong. Super Reddit and Super Google has been cracking down on the lack of ratings as of late, so if you see a Helldriver in the field and catch a lift with them make sure to give them a glowing review. 

Finally, do remember to enjoy your mandatory 2.4 seconds of enjoying the view and never feel ashamed to ask your driver to pull over to stop for 2.4 seconds of relaxation amidst the cries of the undemocratic legions we are exterminating. 

Yours Kindly,
