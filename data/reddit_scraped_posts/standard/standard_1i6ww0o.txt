The idea of captain fantastic is that a father raises his children outside society and public education but teaches them everything they need to know. They are socialised outside of traditional norms and their hobbies, interests and values are very different. My favourite scene in this film his when the eldest son confronts his father about this and how he had made them into freaks. The actors give such great performances and really feel the weight off each word. I know alot of people dislike this film and i can see its flaws as a whole but this one scene will always stay with me.
