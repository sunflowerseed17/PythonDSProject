It’s been two years since I (45) found out my wife (36)  had an affair with my nephew (28) during the lockdown. I caught them when her phone rang while she was bathing . He cut the phone . I checked her whatsapp and discovered that they’d been involved for months . Confronting her led to a full confession, and I told my elder sister everything about the affair .

After the fallout, my elder sister (52) decided to fix the situation by arranging my nephew’s marriage shortly after. It’s been two years now, and while life has somewhat moved on, I can’t shake this lingering awkwardness . 

Every time I attend a family function and see my nephew, I feel this deep discomfort. Everyone in the family knows about what happened, and it’s like there’s this unspoken tension hanging in the air whenever we’re in the same room. It’s humiliating, even if no one openly talks about it anymore.

I’ve tried to focus on my marriage and rebuilding trust with my wife (a decision I still question at times), but being around my nephew feels like reliving the betrayal all over again. It’s especially tough knowing he’s now married and has seemingly moved on while I’m stuck carrying this emotional baggage.

I still can't look at her without feeling disgusted. When I confronted her back then, she told me everything in explicit detail - things I didn't even want to know. Now, I can't erase those images from my mind.

Every time I see her, all I can think about is what they did together. It's like I'm stuck replaying scenes of their affair in my head. I asked for these details and she confessed everything - how it started, how far it went, and how it happened while I was quarantined during the lockdown. 

This has left me emotionally paralyzed. I can't connect with her the same way anymore. It's like the intimacy we once had has been tainted forever. I try to move forward, but the explicit knowledge of what happened keeps pulling me back. I feel trapped .
