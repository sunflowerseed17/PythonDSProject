Title: ELI5 : Why do Texans have to wrap their pipes and drip their faucets when it freezes? Why don't they just do whatever it is that people in Minnesota do in order to avoid pipes bursting when it freezes?

I grew up in Minnesota and have never had to wrap my pipes or drip my faucets when it's cold.  
Why is it that now that I live in Texas I have to drip my faucets and wrap blankets around my pipes to stop them from exploding when Minnesotans don't have to do anything? Can't we just do whatever they do in Minnesota?
