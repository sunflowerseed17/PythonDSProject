I'm trying to work on a project on minecraft bedrock of a Smartcity, and I don't really know how to replicate real life solar panels. I've tried using the daylight detector, but it doesn't convince me. I just want to replicate like the structure, it doesn't have to be functional. Hope somebody can help me :).
