So the idea of being the most de facto “evil” preset of a Tav but forcing them to commit to their oath and resist the dark urge sounds really fun to me! But don’t wanna end up doing this and suffering cause I have to pay back my oath every hour. Any chance it could work or should I just stick to durge paladin without everyone weird about my race?
