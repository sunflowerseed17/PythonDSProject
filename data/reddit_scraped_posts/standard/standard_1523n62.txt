Hi UKPF

I've got a car loan for 5K at 20% (bad credit history) over 2 years. I'm in full time work, however part of that is cover for a colleague on long term sick leave and likely to end in December, losing me 2 days out of 5 though I'm hopeful I will pick up another position to cover that, but no guarantees.

I had been saving Â£1k pcm and had been looking to buy outright, but the right car came up earlier than expected so took the loan intending to pay off much earlier, hoping by 1st November.

Anyway, I paid 1k down today, and was asked if I wanted that off the principle or to reduce the monthly payments. I chose reducing the payments, should I have paid off the principle instead?
