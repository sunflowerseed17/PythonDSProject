Hey all, a while back I posted about issues sharing to find out I was stuck behind CGNAT.
Every so often someone bans me when I try to download, usually with an auto response. I immediately reply letting them know I'm cgnat crippled and apologise. None of them unban me.
A couple of days ago one auto message suggested I shouldn't just allow access to my SS download folder. So I changed my downloadfolder to my main collection. Can anyone check if my collection now shows up doing this? User name is tartanthing.
