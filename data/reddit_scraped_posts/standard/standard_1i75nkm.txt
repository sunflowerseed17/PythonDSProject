Now that Palworld's been out for a year, have any of you changed which pal you take everywhere since launch, or do you still have the same pal (or two) you hold near and dear and refuse to put in your palbox? For me, it was my lucky Foxparks named Fuji, took her from start to endgame. I only had to put her away at the very end so I could get an extra Rooby for the final boss.
