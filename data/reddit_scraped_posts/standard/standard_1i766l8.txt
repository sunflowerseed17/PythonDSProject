Hi friends! Just wanted to rant a little as a support main. I was trying my best playing a match and I admit our loss was because of my disconnection. By the time I rejoined, the enemy team was already reaching point.  Then this mei in vc starts yelling so loud at me that my headphones were vibrating. This dude was so tilted about my deaths and stats when he was dying just as much. Plus, my stats had reset when I rejoined so I was at 0-2 with 400 healing. This was in a lobby of silver 3 and 4. 

I was just so thrown off at how triggered this guy got to the point of screaming at a stranger online. This is silver and I’m sure he’ll be able to win another game. I’ve worked my way up from bronze and I know how difficult it is down there. Silver is so much easier. 

I’m laughing at it now because of how ridiculous it was. Fortunately in the end my team defended me and told the chat to report him. People like them are what I appreciate about the OW community. This was the most jarring experience I’ve encountered so far. And maybe there’s more to come. Has anyone had any toxic interactions?
