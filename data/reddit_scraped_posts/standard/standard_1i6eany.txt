First time tackling a full room to this extent. I’m aware the drywall patch (mainly the mud job) is…lackluster. But it was my first time and I learned *alot*. When the kiddo grows up and moved out I’ll probably rip all the drywall and re-do the room for something else but that’s years away. Good enough for a little dude for now.
