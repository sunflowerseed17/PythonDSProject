I’ve been on a mission to find a main champ for a couple of seasons, i have played ranked to emerald and want to get to diamond. I get bored easily and usually dont play same champs many times. I think i know the game well but i havent mastered any champ to a point i could climb more. So recommend me a champ and explain me why you like it and i’ll try it.
