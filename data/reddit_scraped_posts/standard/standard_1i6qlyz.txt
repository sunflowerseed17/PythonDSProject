Maybe it is more suitable for Acting subreddit, but I wanted to know what audience thinks. Is Range and Charisma two completely different thing in an Actor? If so, how come? I have seen many say "Gal Gadot is not a good actor, but she has charisma". What is it that makes audience think that way about any actor, thinking that they are charismatic even if they are not skilled?
