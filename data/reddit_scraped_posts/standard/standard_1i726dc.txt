I'm doing Honour mode and went to the Goblin Camp to get the owlbear cub from the Goblins. I made the mistake of accidently grouping my party back up when I went to do the race. Thinking I had to separate them myself. 
When I went to start the race the goblin screams too many players, but I'm not grouped with them anymore. 

Is there anything I can do to fix this? I don't want to leave the cub behind. The race is how I usually get him without starting a fight because I don't want to risk losing him ðŸ˜­ 

Please help!
