Basically the title, we are two-three weeks into the new season and while the pass seems to level much more slowly I am pretty sure there are some people who already got a relatively high level (maybe even gotten to level 50) and I realized in my ranked and aram games during these weeks I have not seen a single person using the paid pass skins (or the free Elise Skin for that matter) not even the Prestige Katarina skin lmao

I really hope it's a sign people might not be buying it a whole lot meaning Riot will have to rework it to give better and more rewards both free and paid but it may still be a bit too early to take it as a definitive sign due to how slowly the pass seems to level. But I am curious, am I the only one with that perception?
