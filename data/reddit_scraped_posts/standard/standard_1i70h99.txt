Throwaway cause my roommate knows my account.

I (19F) started college this year and live in a dorm. I've had another roommate for a few months, but she transferred majors a few weeks ago and left our dorm and a new one moved in exactly 3 weeks ago. My new roommate (20F) is religious while I am not, and while I don't have any issues with religion, an issue arises between us because of it. 

Here's the thing, she has a prayer she has to perform around dawn, say around 5 30 am our local time and she sets an alarm at said time. We sleep in the same room, and I am a pretty light sleeper while she's an extremely heavy sleeper, so the first few times I woke up first and went and woke her up. This quickly got annoying though, after waking up to her alarm I find it difficult to fall back asleep because by that time the sun is up and I just end up tired through my classes.

I expressed this to her, how I find it annoying that her alarms will keep ringing on and on for 30 to 45 minutes before she finally woke up and how she should just set one alarm which should be more than enough. She said she would try but couldn't promise since it's really important to her to wake up and pray.

Unfortunately, the next night nothing changed, the alarm kept ringing and ringing and I was just fed up. for the next 3 or 4 nights, I'd let the first alarm ring, then I'd switch off her phone altogether and finally go back to sleep.

She obviously caught on and confronted me about it and I honestly admitted to it. She argued with me and said I was a terrible person for trying to stop her from praying when I'm just trying to get a few extra hours of sleep so AITA? How else should I go about this?
