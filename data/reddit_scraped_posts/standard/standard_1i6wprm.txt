glitch productions is an indie animation studio, mostly famous as the studio behind murder drones and the amazing digital circus, 2 of the most famous web animations of the 2020s. recently, it was announced that they will collaborate with the creators of the owl house on their first 2D series, knights of guinevere.

ever since the announcement of the new project, i've been thinking quite a bit about glitch productions and wondered what a movie made by them could potentially be like. would it be released theatrically, on a streaming service, or on youtube? would it be 2D or 3D? would it feature voice actors or actual movie stars?

i also wonder what the reception would be. glitch productions has a pretty good track record of acclaimed works. perhaps they could capture that same lightning in a bottle with a movie.

would you like to see glitch productions make a movie?
