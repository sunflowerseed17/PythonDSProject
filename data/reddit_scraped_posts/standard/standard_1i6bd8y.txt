Feeling like a one woman pity party tonight so Iâ€™ll keep this in bullet point form. 
-Got sick with the flu 12/17 and was knocked down by it for nearly 3 weeks, despite getting my flu shot. 
-Discovered on 1/15 that our 7 year old cat had advanced terminal cancer and had to put him down unexpectedly. 
-Same day, 1/15 my 13 yo son fell ill with the flu. 
-On 1/17 my 8 year old son started showing flu symptoms as well. So. Much. Puke. ðŸ¤¢ 
-Today I have come down with flu #2 (thanks kids) and am battling my 2nd medium grade fever in less than 30 days. 

Would like a winter do-over, please.
