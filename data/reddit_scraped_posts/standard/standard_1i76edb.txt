The current form of the Nuggets is getting better and better. They are trying to find ways to help Jamal Murray regain his form. The opponents in the Western Conference this year are not particularly strong. In the playoff matchups, the Nuggets might be the best team. It is estimated that Russell Westbrook will win his first championship in his career.
