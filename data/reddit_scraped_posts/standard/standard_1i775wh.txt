So I was never bitten by the WoW bug when I was younger, but having played through the entirety of FFXIV and learning from others that supposedly my gripes with the game were solved with WoW, I'm considering giving the game a shot.

So with all that said, I'd like a *lot* of confirmation on certain things with the game, and questions about if Classic is the way to go.

So firstly, how does the game's combat compare to FFXIV? A big point of complaint I had with the game was everything feeling so samey, almost like a rhythm game. Every single dungeon no matter what I did, what class I was playing it was just deal damage. Is that somewhat mitigated in this game? Like do I actually have to do things to manage aggro? Is there an actual decent deal of skill expression and on the fly thinking I need to do?

Second, I kind of wanted to hear about community, a thing I like about MMO's is the meeting people aspect. I'd love to hear what the general community is like.

Third is actual character creation. I'm pretty much already locked in on what race/class I'd like to play, but what is the early game like? Is it worth doing? I've heard there's like a skip or something that gets you to a higher level when you make a character but I don't remember too many details.

Finally is probably more of a subjective thing but is the game actually worth playing in its current state? This might be a bit of a divisive topic but the state of the game is something I'd like to here before I actually attempt to support it.

Thanks in advance for any input, even if I don't respond I'll have definitely read your feedback, and I appreciate all of it!
