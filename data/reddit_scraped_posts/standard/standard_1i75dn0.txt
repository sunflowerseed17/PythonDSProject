I intercepted in the second she stopped casting the dust . The healer had aggro the instant the dust had ended, so I mocking blowed first global after intercept and she immuned it. I understand she can't be taunted during the dust but she was already AUTO ATTACKING my healer at this point. sadly be the time my next global was up to taunt the healer had already died (they got like 2shot).just wanted to know is this a bug or am I missing somthing?
