So when it comes to purchasing the new series off NVIDIA’s website. Will NVIDIA be selling them straight from their website or linking you to a partner website to buy the GPUs.

I was thinking that my best bet to getting a new GPU would be to do pick up possibly on Best Buy the moment I’m allowed to.
