I’m a Police officer and yesterday I was called to a heated argument at a car wash.

Upon arrival I found that a car wash employee had crashed an elderly man’s car, and they were refusing to give him his keys back until he paid for the wash. 

I exchanged insurance details between them and told them they had to give him his keys back so he could have his car towed. They refused.

After a 20 minute discussion and numerous attempts to solve it like adults, the employee had to be placed under arrest for larceny before he finally gave this poor man his keys back.

The part that infuriated me is the audacity to expect payment after totalling this man’s car. Even the tow truck driver attempted to justify it by saying “Well he still needs to be paid for his time”.. 

Being a cop tests your faith in humanity everyday but this one just really left a bad taste in my mouth. In all my years this is the first time I’ve ever actually lost my cool and yelled at someone.

Ultimately they weren’t paid and they were told they will have to sue him civilly because Im not forcing him to pay.

Maybe I’m wrong and let my personal ethics sway me, so I’m curious to hear other people’s thoughts
