So, the old patio cover was rotting and weirdly built and had leaks. 
I did a full tear down. Cut back the roof to the wall, framed. Sheathed, roofed, painted and added electrical. Its not perfect but it's very structurally secure and I feel, much nicer than before.
Considering painting the concrete and considering making the 4x4 post more fancy. 
Also gotta do a few paint touch ups on the fascia.

When I cut back the roof back in December, the forecast was 2 weeks of dry weather. Then a huge storm hit a few days into that and we got some water damage because I did a dumb and didn't prepare properly.

I did some things to try and quick fix with roofing rubber cement and plastics. It worked well enough to secure thru the storm. Once the storm ended, forecast was dor 2 days of dry...
So I got a few sheets of plywood and started the roof from the edge nearest the house. It's not what I wanted(I wanted to roof it all starting from the end of the porch) but I did what I had to to stop the water. This turned out to be rhe smart move as the next storm, a few days later, was pretty big also.

Once things cleared up again I was able to finish sheathing and roll on the roof.
Some vague and misleading info online got my drip edge adhesive fucked up, but got there in the end.
She is not perfect but she's secure and water tight.
