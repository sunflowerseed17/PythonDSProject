Tonsillectomy (my first surgery ever) gone wrong. 

Day of surgery surprisingly went well, its when night fell. 

Couldnt eat much, off and on sleep. 

I woke up with something pooling in my mouth and I spit it out and it was blood. Not just a little but A LOT. 

I cup my hand with it, find a rag to hold it and find my bf on the couch. Showing him whats going on because when I try to talk the blood pours out faster. 

I run to the bathroom, and start vomitting it at this point. I remember him just staring right at the door. I had to tell him to call 911 like with my hand, etc. 

Ok serious question though. I know people can go into shock when they see things like this and I woke him from a dead sleep.

I also know him and hes the quickest person I have ever met, super jumpy as is, has been through some crap and has a job where he helps developmental disabled people. 

AITA for thinking he wasnt moving quick enough for me because he doesnt care as much or because he thought I was being over the top or something?

I am honestly pretty hurt by it and its completely changed the way I look at him.
