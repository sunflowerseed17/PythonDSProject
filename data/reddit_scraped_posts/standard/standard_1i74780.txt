Hi there. Usually I can play overwatch fine, but tonight I haven’t been able to get on because it fails to connect me to the servers. When I go to the blizzard app, it says I’m playing now when I have overwatch closed. I tried task manager, but overwatch isn’t on there either, so I’m at my wits end :(
