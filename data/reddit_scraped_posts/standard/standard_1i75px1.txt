I’m 20 and my sister is 17 for context

My sister doesn’t have a job, she has had two before, both with me. Her most recent job at my current company ended with her being fired. I was at a concert and wasn’t at work and someone filling in asked another manager how I do my cash out. My sister replied and she apparently said “respectfully I was asking *other manager*” (obviously not the most nice way of responding)  This resulted in her swearing and yelling fck this place and sobbing in front of a crowd of customers. She was not invited back to work. My parents say I need to get her a job or hire her back after she’s been fired (my boss says no because she’s too much of a train wreck) This was a year ago and she hasn’t done anything or looked. If i fight to hire her back am i enabling her bad behaviour? Should she get a job herself because it’s her responsibility? We also share a car I pay for entirely (maintenance, gas, insurance) and she says she won’t ever need to pay for it because my parents will leave it to me or pay for her so she doesn’t think she needs a job.

Looking for some insight 

edit: car is my moms old one so it’s in her name- i used to have co ownership but she took it away when my sister got her license so i wouldn’t have power over it
