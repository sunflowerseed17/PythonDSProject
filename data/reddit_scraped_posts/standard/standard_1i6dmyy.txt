Our restoration contractor replaced all our cabinets, but we'd asked for a farmhouse sink and they gave us a sink cabinet that won't fit one.

We bought a temporary base cabinet that will fit the sink so we can at least have a sink until we can afford to redo the kitchen the way we'd like.

The plumber already set up the supply lines in the cabinets installed by the restoration company. I can't figure out how to get the current cabinet out with the supply lines sticking through it.

We also don't have any countertops yet.

We can't afford to replace everything at once....

What kinds of contractors do I need to hire and in what order to get a functional kitchen even if the cabinets won't match for now?

- Swap out sink base cabinet (what kind of contactor)
- Remove supply lines and put them back after swapping? (Plumber, or can the cabinet guys do this?)
- Install undermount apron farmhouse sink (who?)
- get countertops (are cabinet people different than countertop people?)
- save up and replace cabinets or at least their fronts with matching ones...
