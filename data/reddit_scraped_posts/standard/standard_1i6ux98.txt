From what I heard and seen, Nick Cave's Gladiator II script sounded kinda of weird. Maximus going to Heaven, then gets revenge, then at the end of the screenplay, he lives to the modern-day. I say this, Gladiator didn't need a sequel at all, the ending wrapped up perfectly and all loose ends were tied. And Cave knew that Russell Crowe wasn't going to like the script at all, then the script was rejected and scrapped after Steven Spielberg, who had consulted on the original film, told Ridley Scott it wasn't going to work, especially as Cave had written something "too grand" due to his theatre work.

I haven't seen the actual Gladiator II and probably never will because of how the first one was so good but I didn't hear good things at all. However, Nick Cave's screenplay wasn't used at all for the real Gladiator II so it was never made.

Then we have the Elf 2 screenplay, I read a few parts of the script a few years back (I don't remember it that well) but it seemed like that it wasn't all that good and interesting. There's a reason why Will Ferrell turned down a huge paycheck to respire his role as Buddy the Elf and even I also think that Elf didn't really need a sequel as it all wrapped up perfectly. I can say that Elf is a classic but no sequel was needed because of how well it wrapped up.

There are tons of more of bad screenplays out there but the two are prime examples of the worst movie scripts I have read.
