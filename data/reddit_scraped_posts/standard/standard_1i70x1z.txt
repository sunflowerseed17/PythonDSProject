In Palworld, you see statues of several pals throughout the land; mainly notably powerful ones.  
There, in my mind, are two classifications for these simply put as 'Lords' and 'Legends'.

One of the statues you'll see is this one depicting a fight between two similar looking pals.  
As people on this reddit are aware, These are the legendary knights clashing against each other; Necromus against Paladius. My fan theory is that this is shortly after they were separated because we have a ying-yang/Kyurem situation with these two from their palpedia entries.

The other legends; Frostallion, Frost Noct, and Jetragon, all in one way or another protect the island from danger. While that can be expected of the Knights, they're both... bland in the description department.

The main implication is that their original form was strong enough to essentially separate into full on Legends, giving us a relative idea of just how strong they used to be.

Now, as a player, all the Legends, in one way or another, stand out in some gameplay aspect. I'm going to go over them in the same order that, with meta knowledge, people generally go after 'em.

\---

**Frostallion**. You encounter them in the endgame frost mountains. The arena itself completely frozen with no snow inside it; likely due to being Frostallion's home, and you, the player, should more then likely have a fire pal to help you traverse this cold terrain. The arena gives you significant protection from some Frosty's more dangerous attacks.

Once captured, Frostallion is a huge benefit to the player.  
Their passive is the only way to give the player Ice Damage to their attacks. It's a fast flying mount. It has exclusive breed paths to both Frosty Noct AND Bastigor; both of which are insanely good pals. It has lv4 cooling. Amazing pal for combat and is unlikely to ever be truly replaced.

**Jetragon**. Using the Frosty you just captured, you can traverse the volcano's heated environment with relative ease and while Frosty isn't strong against the average mob there, it's a beast against Jetragon that, with some skill on the players part, can avoid the more devastating fire attacks Jet may have.

Jetragon's purpose is speed. Without even trying, it'll be faster then anything you can breed at this point in the game and likely ever will. If there was ever a reason why the Anti Air exists (outside of flying just being strong) it's purely for Jetragon's outrageous speed that can blitz through the map with ease. 

An extremely solid dragon pal that, if you take the time to farm it, drops the Legendary Rocket Launcher; one of the best weapons in the game. Granted, it's lost some shine as Feybreak has came out and has a new strongest weapon, but the relative ease to obtain this versus the others makes it pretty fucking great.

[Wanted to break up this section a bit, your eyes will thank me.](https://preview.redd.it/3mgh9cyebgee1.png?width=651&format=png&auto=webp&s=53a4693e66994585bd286903cf5012d7cdd9fade)

The thing that immediately stands out to anyone going after them with their new shiny Jet is that they travel together in the desert, which is the least dangerous area of all the Legends to reside in. 

Fighting a 2 v 2 or a 2v1 if you choose to stay mounted, and you'll realize that fighting them, they're the toughest fight of all the Legends. Relatively open area, they collectively have more HP then the other Legends (22k\~ vs 16k\~ last I checked), and Paladius has it's shield which just outright reduces damage to 1.

However, if you're not new to fighting them, you just arrive at night. Paladius will be asleep while Necromus will be awake and it trivializes the entire encounter as you pull him just far enough away to lower his hp and capture him before starting the entire cycle again on Paladius.

They both aren't appealing to farm because, like Frosty, they give you legendary armor that was amazing when the level cap was 50 and decent at 55.

Well, what do these two do that make them standout as captured pals?

They both have Lumbering 2 and Mining 2 which is... unfortunate.   
Anubis already is a more solid mining pal then them, Astegon is the best at this point in the game due to lv4 AND being a dark type.   
Lumbering wise, they were already on par with a Deer in the opening area and you should already have a Bushi for lv3 lumbering. You also have access to Bastigor which is lv4 cooling, lv3 lumbering, AND lv3 mining. 

Paladius; as of now, has an exclusive path! Paladius + Lunaris makes Selyne! The only Neutral/Dark Pal in the entire game; also the only Neutral Pal with another typing! I guess Selyne is the best Neutral Battle Mount in the entire game? It's great with Handicraft and does good medicine AND transport work, but those aren't anything to write home about.

Necromus? Nothing, nada, zilch. 

Even then, you won't really use them in breeding like like Frosty, who gives the best Gathering Pal in the game, who is also the best Dark Mount, and the currently best Cooling Pal; Bastigor. Unless, of course, you're a massive fan of Selyne.

Mounts! Well what about it? Necromus and Paladius give up to 20% extra move speed from their stars and while they get extra jumps, double jumps are already in good supply with Fenglope; imo, being the best ground mount in the game for exploration and while the triple jump is cute, it doesn't have the same height as other mount's extra jumps. Sure, they're technically the 1st and 2nd fastest ground mounts in the game, but considering that Legends require much more effort to get the right traits vs a common pal (barring Frosty Noct) using them as mounts isn't really worth it when you can breed a Fenglope with Engine, Legend, Swift, and Runner (+75% Stamina and +65% Movespeed) 

Also, not to mention, Jetragon is able to zoom, so speed REALLY isn't something you're dying for when you have that in your back pocket.

Ok... kinda running out of reasons to actually want to use them. Actually, I think that's it.

Not used for Combat. Not used for Base Activities. One isn't even used for Breeding. Neither are even worth Butchering.  
You can't even argue that 'Oh, just farm the < 1% books to get them to lv5â€“' Bastigor exists, moving on.

So... that's it? You're telling me the Legendary Duo of the game is just... kinda meh?   
It's a shame. I really like them both! Their theming is something I always enjoy, the boss fight; when not cheesed, is properly fun! 

I can't even say that Paladius can carry the title of the 'Best Neutral Combat Pal' in the game when a Pal like Selyne exists! At least Paladius HAS it's triple jump and Natural Shield, poor Necromus has nothing to it's name besides being the fastest ground mount, but I've already explained why that doesn't matter.

[It's just me begging for several paragraphs, you're missing nothing really substantial beyond ideas and speculation.](https://preview.redd.it/sst8s1hmdgee1.png?width=618&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb3b58a69d22bf734db025b6ab2cf4225871781b)

Well, the most immediate idea is a way to combine the two. This way, Paladius and Necromus would be nothing more then stepping stones for the TRUE form and it would make sense why they both are just so bland currently in both the Palpedia AND as Pals, but outside of combining their types, giving it lv4 Mining AND Lumbering, and both of of their exclusive moves, there's nothing really obvious they would do with it. Maybe they can combine their mount speeds and extra jumps? 3000 RideSprintSpeed and 4 Jumps would be borderline flying. For comparison, Jetragon is 3300 RideSprintSpeed.

Well, what about actually working on the Knight's themselves? What would I want to tweak first?

Well, their passives; and personally, I'm surprised they didn't do this considering we have two other pals in the game that already have 4? pals that do it! 

'''While in team, appears near the player.'''

Now granted, all of those pals float, but we can already walk around with our pal out, so why not? Well, their size might also be an issue... Well, maybe they only appear if the Player is in combat while unmounted? Like backup on demand! So that way, when you actually do get into a fight, they'll come out to help you fight off the threat! Maybe it even works if you're mounted on one of them, including the shenanigans of like 4/5 Paladius or more likely 4/5 Necromus all just stomping something into the ground.

A boring answer would be 'just give them more movement speed with each upgrade.' So instead of 20% at max, it could be 40%? Hell, I'd be fine if they tripled it, but i still don't know if that would be worth the effort of obtaining it. I don't really see them as travel mounts, their entire design screams 'BATTLE', so this idea I'm not really fond of.

Another boring answer would be to gain +X% Player Defense and +X% Player Attack respectively; essentially stepping in on Gobfin's niche, but it would have to be like double of what Gobfin gives to even be considered as an option and Paladius might not even be picked at all due to Player Defense not being as sought after.

Maybe they buff each other if the other is in the party? Every Necromus buffs Paladius and vice versa? Leads to instances of 4 Necro + 1 Pala with a mega buffed Pala? We already had low level pals that can do that, so maybe if someone REALLY wants to put in the effort, they can get something truly terrifying.

If the 'PAIR' focus wanted to be double downed on, maybe an alternative? Maybe the inactive knight gives its stat buffs to the active knight? Like, "If you only have 1 Necromus in your party, share it's stat buffs with Paladius when it's active," So, by default, if you carried both pals, Legend would give them +40% ATK, +40% DEF, and +30% Movespeed. Includes Food buffs too! So if you put effort into maxing them both out; a herculean trial due to them being Legends, then they would be just the strongest battling pal in the game. A fitting idea for the Knight duo, imo.

Also, can we take a moment to mention that Selyne just buffs it's own Neutral/Dark damage when mounted to upwards of 100%. That's crazy. Frosty and Frosty Noct also do that too as well as the element shift AND player attack buff. Couldn't the Knights also do something similar; bare minimum.

https://preview.redd.it/j2kkf40algee1.png?width=446&format=png&auto=webp&s=620a5eb0400e2bd95d5578ed5413b0297ebabcb0

Idk, this has all been just pure speculation. I really enjoy these two, but the disgusting meta gamer inside me is like, "You you're really wanting to spend HOURS maxing these two out, when you could spend less time and effort just making a better common pal for the exact same stuff you want them for?"  
  
And no. Legends/Raid Bosses are already HORRID to breed for; again, barring Frosty Noct. It would just be simpler for me to max out a Yakumo and rng the captures instead.

The main takeaway is that I want these two to not only FEEL epic, but to have a purpose, because as of right now, despite Paladius being one of my favorite pals in the game, I can't really justify to make myself a maxed out version of it until I'm literally finished with all my other priorities because it would just ultimately be a pet project.

Also last thing, can we just have Paladius wake up when Necromus aggros onto something. It's a duo. One should get alerted if the other is about to fight.

Thanks for listening to me ramble about something that most peeps probably don't/won't even care about. Game's in early access, things can change, but I just have the sinking suspicion that these two will just continue being quite meh for the foreseeable future.
