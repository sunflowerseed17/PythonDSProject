This happened a couple of weeks ago, and I’ve been struggling to get my head around it. My mate, let’s call him James, is 20 and we’ve been close mates for years. He’s always been welcome at mine, and my parents don’t mind us hanging out here. My mum’s in her early 40s, but she looks younger for her age and takes good care of herself. James has made a few cheeky comments in the past, like, “Your mum’s proper fit,” but I never thought much of it. I always just brushed it off as banter, even though it was a bit awkward at times.

The other day, James came over for a gaming session, and at one point, he said he needed the loo. I didn’t think anything of it, but after about 15 minutes, he still hadn’t come back. I paused the game and went upstairs to see what he was doing. That’s when I noticed my parents’ bedroom door was slightly open, and I heard the sound of a phone camera clicking. My heart dropped. I quietly walked up to the door, and when I peeked inside, I couldn’t believe what I saw. He had one of my mum’s dresses laid out on the bed, and he was holding up her underwear, taking pictures of it.

I just lost it. I shoved the door open and shouted, “What the f*** are you doing?” He spun around, trying to shove his phone in his pocket, and started stammering something about it “not being what it looks like.” I told him to give me his phone, but he refused and pushed past me, running out of the house. I was absolutely fuming, but I didn’t chase after him. I haven’t spoken to him since, and I don’t even know what to do now. Do I tell my parents? Part of me feels like they should know, but I also don’t want to upset my mum or make things awkward in the house.
