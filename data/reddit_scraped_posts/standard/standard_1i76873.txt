I love steam, i am literally gaben's little servant, and i have played a lot of games on there, and sometimes, a game i like, will have limitations with its achievement, whether its a puzzle game where the last achi bugged, or something tedious like spinning with a skateboard for 30 mins, and it triggers a minor form of OCD in me that turns me off the game.

I play games for fun, but i also like to achi hunt TO AN EXTENT. I love to achi hunt in resident evil and fromsoftware games, because their achi design helps you discover everything the game can offer, but metaphor refantazio isnt the same, with its "sword surfer" achievement, as an example, or kingdom come deliverance with its "david horak" achi. Seeing these just turns me off the game because i obsess over achis, and it ruins my fun.

I then found about SAM, not very long ago, and I had some time to think about using it, moralities, ethics, and for what, and once i took the plunge, it felt like a weight has been put off my chest, now i can replay metaphor on my steam deck without fixating on stupid sword surfer, and i dont have to keep trying to hunt for the stupid 38th file on RE village after 3 playthrough of file hunting. I can ENJOY the game the way i want.

I might be a filthy cheater now, but im having fun with my games in ways i couldnt before, and thats fucking awesome
