Hello, I pricked my hand on a rusty safety pin which was somehow hiding inside my pillow. The safety pin looks pretty old . I lost little bit of my skin and and a drop blood. Should I take a tetanus shot.. I did have 2 TT shots last Feb and March as part of my pregnancy vaccinations. I have heard that TT shots are good for 5 years or so.. Should I take another one or will it be fine?
