Hello I (m19) went on a ski trip with my girlfriend and her group of friends. I had asked her roommate a week or two prior if I could ride with her because my car couldn’t make it up. She said as long as I pay gas money of course I can. We all get up there and have a few drinks that night. One of the guys was skiing for the first time and was only going to ski the first day. I offered up my seat on the way back because I was going to stay with a different group and ride down later and ski the second day. The next morning I told him that I actually needed the ride back because I have school to do and I don’t have time to ski. He was upset because he had to get his rental down or he would be charged. I thought that was his problem because he didn’t even have a ride back in the first place and did not plan ahead. I was then woken up at 3 am getting told that I no longer have a ride because she was taking the other guy and I would have to wait until 5 pm to come down with the other group. I told the driver that wasn’t right and she cannot kick me out when she already offered me the ride. The next day she took me but has been very rude to me since. AITA?
