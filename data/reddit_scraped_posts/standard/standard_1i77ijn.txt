so i got clorinde, and i normally use Kokomi - Yelan/Raiden - Arlecchino - Kazuha, but she doesnt really work with that (in yelan/raidens place)

so I was wondering if anyone knew what characters that I own work best with her. Im willing to build anyone lol.

green means good build
orange means medium/half build
red means no build currently
