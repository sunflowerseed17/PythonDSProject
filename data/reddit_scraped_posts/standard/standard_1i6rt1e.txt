I'm watching the Hunger Games right now and thinking how much better they would be (and these movies are already pretty good) if they went hard on the R rating. They're movies about kids killing kids for entertainment and propaganda that becomes a full on civil war battle story. But we can't see blood or hear swearing. It's crazy that they're not rated R as is. 

So what other franchises would benefit from going R?
