Hey there fellow enthusiasts, I wanted to know if there has been any confirmation regarding the 8000s or 9000s RX series, as I was planning on getting 7800XT , but if some newer models were to drop, I'd wait to bag one for better performance and less money, don't want to be like those RTX 4090 owners >.>
