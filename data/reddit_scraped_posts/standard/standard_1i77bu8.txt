My bf and I began designing my engagement ring today. When the jeweller asked if my bf has a date in mind and asked about upcoming holidays my bf said he’d talk to her about that without me there. 

This obviously means he has a date in mind but the only holidays we have planned this year is an overseas destination wedding. We’re staying there for 5 days and the wedding is obviously only one day. 

We don’t have any special locations as we met at work and didn’t really go on dates so there’s no where I can think of that’s sentimental where he would propose. 

AITA if he were to propose on the part of the holiday that has nothing to do with the wedding? I’m a bit nervous if this is his plan and want an outside perspective.
