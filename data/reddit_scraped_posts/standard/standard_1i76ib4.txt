Hello all, 

I decided to update my PC 
I have i5-4650 and 1660 super with gigabyte z97 gaming 3 

My budget doesn't allow me to go all thinks together but 
I will by a new CPU with Ram and MB for now.

I decided to go with AMD Ryzen 5 7600x 
But I confused about the ram and MB 

I need a good MB , quality, Reliable and doesn't have any issues 

I will use this PC for gaming and coding mainly.

Any suggestions and advices it's most welcome üòÅ.
