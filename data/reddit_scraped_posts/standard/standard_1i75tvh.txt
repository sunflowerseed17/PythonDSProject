The update brought some new changes(can choose api and gpu in settings now) and i believe some have broken a few things. Windowed, Windowed(Fullscreen) work as normal but Fullscreen makes my game stutter like crazy, including sound and basically unplayable, also alt-tabbing becomes very slow and i constantely have the "Restar game to apply changes" banner in the bottom of the settings after rebooting many times. 

I never had any of these issues before, does anyone have a solution?
