In a normal cycle, we enter the luteal phase up until  our periods start. This phase is characterized by mood swings, bloating, breast tenderness, hunger cravings, acne, etc.

Because Iâ€™m so irregular (1 period every 9-18 months), does this mean im constantly in a luteal phase? Could this attribute to the terrible weight issues I have, always craving terrible foods? And the others issues described above?

Please educate me, thank you.
