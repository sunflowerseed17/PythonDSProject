So we have lived in our house for 15 yrs. It’s a small cape with four of us. I want a decluttered house and struggle with wanting to go minimalist but also not wanting to get rid of all my things. I love books and have a somewhat small out of place book shelf. Every time I look at it I just want to get rid of all the books and remove the shelf, then o go to my SIL who has this huge gorgeous book case loaded and then I get (jealous? I hate that word) bc I have to down size. It’s not just books though. It’s everything. We don’t have a lot of closet space. So blankets, sheets, clothes everything needs to be downsized. I get so mad that I have to get rid of my stuff to make our house feel less constricted or claustrophobic. How do you get past feeling like this? We literally have no way to have a huge book shelf that I’d do anything for. Our house is small and has very little open wall space. Even where our living room is we are limited on the size of our couch which seems barely big enough for all of us to sit on. It’s very frustrating. How do I get over all this?
