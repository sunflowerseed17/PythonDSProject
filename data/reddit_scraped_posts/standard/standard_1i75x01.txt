When I first played on the free trial, I remember there was a quest somewhere and that there was some huge fire guy (My memory tells me ragnaros but i could be wrong) on top of a mountain overlooking the whole area. I tried to attack him but I dont think I was able to or was able to get to him. I think the place was really dark or it was nighttime. 

This would have been around the time of cata or maybe mop and I was playing horde most likely. Does anyone know this quest or area im thinking of?
