I (F18) bought my teacher (M maybe  40 MAX) an onion sandwich. Me as a student, have my wishes. I was hungry and went out to the backery to get me something to chew on, as I asked my teacher for permission to go he asked me to buy him something to digest too. He only told me to get something eggless(understandable) and vegetarian; no problem there I respect and tolerate vegetarians. 

Now.. There was only a sandwich called "onion sandwich" and I thought it would be perfect, FYI the onion was only IN the bread! And he also likes cheese and cucumber which was in the sandwich RIGHT. yes. Exactly. 

Now.. His reaction was worse that anybody would ever expect, he was mad and sad, I even returned him the exchange PLUS 10 CENTS!!! He THREATENED to spit in his sandwich, in front of his colleagues.. 

Now...  To everyone's surprise, he liked it. 

Am I the asshole? Should I end it?
