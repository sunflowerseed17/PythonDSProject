Hey all. I found a pdf of this textbook I need for a class but unfortunately it's not the full version and I guess whoever ripped it is requesting I email them for the full version? The email is at the top of the posted image. I was wondering if anyone has encountered anything like this before with college textbooks or if they're familiar with that email. >!&#x200B;!<
