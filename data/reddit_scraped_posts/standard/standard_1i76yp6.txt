I am the best college football bettor that I know of to do it ever 

I don't mean that there isn't some cellar dwellers and mad scientists cooking it down better but as far as the "professional" faces we see on TV and youtube 

I'm not impressed. 
I made a Twitter and it doesn't gain traction I post wins and losses and have multiple parlays I have hit 

What should I do? 
And is there anyone here that's got it down and knows their record is bettor than the "professionals"

I don't want to sell picks btw I'm not about that and that's why I chose twitter
