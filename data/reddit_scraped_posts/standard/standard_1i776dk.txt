So, I play Minecraft in mobile. It's 1.21.51.02 version and java edition. I was having an issue earlier that in external storage my worlds were supposed to be saved in com.mojang and in minecraftworlds folder. But I never found the folder idk why. So I was saving in application and yesterday I accidentally uninstalled the app. Now I reinstalled but my world is gone. Is there any way to recover it or it's just gone forever?
