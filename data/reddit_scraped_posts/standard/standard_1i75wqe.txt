This is nothing much of a conflict or anything, I think. I (F17) have a huge problem with jealousy and envy since I was 8, I know, this sounds like attention seeking behavior since I could've just work on it and change, and maybe I am an attention seeker, idk, you tell me.

I have a group of friend, 5 including me; Sha, Ina, Billie, Amy. Everyone in the group is female. Sha is my closest one, since she have been always by my side from 12 y/o (that makes it 5 year friendship). Sha is also the one who got me into this whole idea of friend group. 

Fyi, I've been in this friend group for 3 years, so our friendship should be pretty strong. But with my problem, I always be the one who doubted everything. Some of the problem in the group are most likely caused by me, yes and I am very much regret that. 

Like this time, I'm not causing a problem, but slowly detaching myself because I got jealous over Sha and Amy getting closer. It's selfish. It was on a random school day (I don't remember when), I heard Sha talking to Amy frequently, sharing some school tools and all that best friends would do to each others and I was outrightly ignored, or maybe I'm too quiet, idk. So then I just don't talk to them, instead, on the full silent mode, only making some noises when talked to.

Sha asked me why do I seemed like I'm mad about something, not talking to them. Sha even told me on text that she and Amy discussed about me. But I brushed her off and texted I'm okay, just busy.

AITA for being jealous? For being dismissive? For being possessive? For being detached?
