Recently watched Super (2010), and it reminded me of God Bless America by Bobcat Goldthwait for multiple reasons. Looking for other extremely edgy violent movies. Some others I can think of are The House That Jack Built, Happiness (though the violence is only one scene), Tusk. This kind of paints the picture of what sort of edginess I'm looking for.
