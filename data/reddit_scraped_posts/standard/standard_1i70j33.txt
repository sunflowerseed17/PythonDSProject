Hello, I'm wondering what the best pals would be for combat as a 5-man group. I've found some stuff with google, but it seems kinda clickbait-y so I'm not sure what's reliable. It's honestly not for any content in particular, it's just to give me something to breed for. 

I have one thing: 
Bellanoir Libero
* Siren of the Void
* Musclehead
* Demon God
* Serenity

Looking for tips on 4 more. One should fly presumably (Jetragon or Xenolord?), maybe I should have a Glider (but I think all are awful in combat?), and then a couple more, but I don't know what.

Thanks for any tips! I'm usually super casual but just trying to do some stuff.
