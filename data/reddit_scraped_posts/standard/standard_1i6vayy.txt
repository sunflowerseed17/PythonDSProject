Hey so I inherited an older house from my grandmother. The bathroom ceiling was flaking (there is no exhaust fan) and I scraped mudded and painted when I first moved in. Fast forward a couple years and the ceiling is flaking again. 

I’m considering putting up PVC ceiling tiles. I’m just unsure if this would cause more problems down the road. Also should I remove the sheetrock before installing the PVC to prevent steam and mold in between the tiles and sheetrock?
