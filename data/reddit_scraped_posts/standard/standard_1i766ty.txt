I’ve been wondering if savings offers—like credit card cashback, shopping during sales, or taking advantage of workplace benefits—really add up in the long run. For example, is it realistic to save a significant amount, like 2-3 months' salary by the end of the year, or are these savings usually minimal?

I recently came across a credit card offering cashback for purchases, which made me question whether these deals genuinely help us save, or if they’re mostly just marketing tactics.

**TL;DR:** Do savings from cashback offers, sales, and workplace benefits add up to something substantial (like 2-3 months' salary per year), or are the savings negligible?
