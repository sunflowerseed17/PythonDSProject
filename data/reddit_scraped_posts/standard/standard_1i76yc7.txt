Currently experiencing an afterglow from Lucy and saw recent footage of the tourist that filmed North Korea and realised that could be footage of place people might never get to see again or once in a lifetime, so curious as to why the world allows such a place and its isolation of being?

Edit: 
Would like to point out I didn’t mean anything close to conflict or so much as intervention, if anything just extremely interested by North Korea’s approach to its existence. 


Edit: 
If your first thought is countries waging war then you are with the fairies.
