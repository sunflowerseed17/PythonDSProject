Building out this linen closet in a small space behind my tub.. my friend made me this nice face frame which I will be hopefully buying a cabinet door to fit.. 

My problem and the ten million dollar question is where the frame meets the ceiling. As you can see the ceiling is not flat and I have about a 1/8" gap on the top left and it's meets flush on the top right.

How should I correct this?? Leave it as is and caulk? Cut away the uneven sheetrock and slide it  up, leaving an uneven reveal on the top of frame?? Should I leave a shadow line (small gap?) ? Or some type of small trim moulding? HELP, advice needed. I was leaning towards notching the sheetrock ceiling on the right side.
