I (31f) and my husband (31m) are expecting a child our first child together. I had planned on having a baby shower then his mother (who lives with us) was taking over and was making all the decisions without me so I decided I just wouldn’t have one. I’m a people pleaser who struggles to stand up for myself it was just was to not have one. That was a few months ago fast forward to now. His mother went out of town to visit a friend for a few weeks and my sister asked if we could plan a baby shower while his mother was gone bc she felt bad i wasn’t having one. My husband and I agreed it would be a good idea and we would plan to have it just a few days after his mother’s return so she could still be present. So today my husband tells his mother about the baby shower bc he doesn’t want to take her being able to get a gift away from her which i completely understand. But then she starts trying to plan and talk games she will do and decorations she will buy and bunch of other things I don’t want. I tell my husband she harassing my sister and I already and I’m getting overwhelmed he says well tell her to stop. I say I already told her we had everything handled and this is why I decided not to have one in the first place and it makes me want to change my mind again and cancel everything. He gets angry and calls his mom and tells her I’m yelling at him over it all. And she can’t buy anything at all. I get upset and cry bc I never said she couldn’t get a gift. I just don’t want her trying to take over and I want him to back me up. Now we are both highly upset with the other he says I’m being an AH I think he was. Was i wrong for complaining about her to him?
