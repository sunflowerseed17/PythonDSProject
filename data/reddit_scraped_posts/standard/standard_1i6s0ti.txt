I have an exterior door with a storm door. There is a draft coming through my front door so I want to replace the old threshold. I also noticed that the current threshold is not wide enough to reach the storm door so there is a bit of a gap. The distance between the door and the storm door is about 5 1/2 inches. 

I saw some wide enough threshold from Home Depot but the riser is just wood. My door is just wood (not prebuilt )with no sealant at the bottom so not sure if it will be tight enough to seal with wood on wood. Also, from the end of my door towards under the storm door there is a slight incline on the flooring so the threshold will probably not sit flush. 
Completely at a loss for the best solution.
