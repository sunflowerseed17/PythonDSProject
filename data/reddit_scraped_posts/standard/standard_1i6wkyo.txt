Before I get 40 comments going "steam down" yes, thanks, i know that.

What I mean to ask if there's any place steam makes announcements about outages, scheduled updates, etc? I'm asking because twitter "x" is a hell place that's not in chronological order, and also because when Steam goes down like this, you cant really log in or view pages on the Website, either. Is there anywhere where Valve and Steam officially make statements worth looking? I looked around here on r/steam but didn't see much in the way of what i'm looking for (scheduled update schedules, down reports, predictions on fix times). If i missed it, let me know!

update following auto flag: This isn't a request for support at all??? This is me asking other people where they get their steam news??? what on earth??? Why would this be flagged or banned???
