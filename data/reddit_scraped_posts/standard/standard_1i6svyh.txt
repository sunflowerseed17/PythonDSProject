I want to place a wall mount phone jack (outlined in red) to replace the box that you see in the picture. Do I need to rip the sheet rock off and drill holes in the studs to run the line or can it be routed somehow behind and along the base boards? I don't want the phone line to be visible. Thanks for the help!
