I live in Hamburg and our city got bombed in operation gomorrha in 1943, which ignited a huge firestorm in the city. We lost a lot of buildings, but there where a lot which still had their walls and beams. 

When I compare it to LA, there seems to be nothing in the paisedes. Not even the walls and only like 2 beams or so. 

So how did the fire get so hot that it could burn down the walls of the multimillion dollar homes?
