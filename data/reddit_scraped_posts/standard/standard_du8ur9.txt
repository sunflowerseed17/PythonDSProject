Office 365 user, I have a workbook with three sheets. If I enter any kind of data in sheet one, I want the correlating cells in the subsequent 2 sheets to change a specific colour, there is no need to copy the data itself. Likewise when I enter data in sheet 2, I want sheet 3 to change correlating cell a different colour, but not interfere with cells coloured by sheet 1's data. Should add that my sheet is 20+ columns and 12 rows, which is why I need colours for quick & easy identification. Tried a few sources but cant the find specific solution to this.

Any suggestions from anyone?
