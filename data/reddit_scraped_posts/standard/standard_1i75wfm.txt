I (23F) want to know if it would be okay to reconnect with my ex-boyfriend (23M) Benedict (fake name). I broke up with him almost 7 years ago.  He didn't communicate with me a lot and I was too shy to address it for months until I realized the relationship was dead. He was always kind and supportive, which at the time was all I thought I needed. We split amicably and have seen each other a few times since. Recently, I had just gotten off work, it was a hard day so I said screw it. I deserve some donuts and lucky for me, I could go across the street to get some, so I pull up to the drive-thru, order my donuts, pull up to the window, and holy bacon strips it's him. I was shocked. I never expected him to be there and I go to get donuts there at least once every 2 weeks. It brought up some feelings that I had no idea were still there. Now I'm wondering if it would be okay if I tried to ask him to grab a bite to eat to catch up on life. I understand that it's been years and he's not the same person anymore, but I feel in my gut that I should try to do this, unlike my brain that's saying you're being delusional.
