Im current leveling up skinning (low 200s right now). Ive barely made any money with it. 

On the other hand Ive been making a decent amount of gold with herbalism. 

Im level 29 druid and heavy leather, medium/heavy hides are my “cash” drops from skinning and they dont compare to the money I make selling swiftthistle/other herbs

Should i drop it and level alchemy instead?
