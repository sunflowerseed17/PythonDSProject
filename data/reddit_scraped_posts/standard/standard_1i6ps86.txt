so i saw echoes of plum grove on sale and it has a bundle with one lonely outpost. was trying to buy 2set and gift one to  friend and find out such bundle is personalise.

plum grove individual -30% $18.50 to $12.95
one post individual -50% $18.50 to $9.25 total is $22.20

bundle is -50% cart showing 40% could be bug anyway priced at $18.43

is there a way around it like i buy both game separately and gift it to my friend though at a higher price and steam will ‘refund’ the extra price to bundle? giving me back $3.77 difference? or im pushing my luck here.
