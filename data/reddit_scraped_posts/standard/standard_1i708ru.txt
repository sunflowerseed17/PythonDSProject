When it comes to gray characters in stories, sooo many people are black and white. Either they're against the person, or make every excuse they can for the person. 

You can stan a character, and hold them accountable.

You can hate a character, but understand their upbringing and the *why*.

Try to be the middle person, you get heat from both ends ðŸ˜­
