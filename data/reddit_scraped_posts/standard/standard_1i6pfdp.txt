Hey all! I'm pretty new to woodworking and would love some advice for some shelves I want to build. These will store my vinyl records, so they'll need to be a little beefy. 

I want to build three shelves that run the entire width of this space, approximately 50 Â¼ " wide and 19" deep. 

I plan on using oak boards. The first image is the space, note the big pole in the front. The second image is the area modeled to show where the studs are (in red) and one shelf as an example.

1. Since they are very wide, I'm concerned about sag. Should I do cleats on both sides and brackets in the middle? I was considering a heavy L bracket. I've read that brackets need to span around 4/5s of shelf depth to help with sagging, but I'm hoping the cleats will help.
2. The studs are not centered in the space. Other than it being visually off, are there any other considerations that would affect the brackets?
3. I also considered doing a floating shelf but with that pole right in front, not sure I would have enough space to slide them on.

Any help is appreciated! Thanks.
