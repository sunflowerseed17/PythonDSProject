I just discovered that you don't have to carry food with you! Send it all to camp and it automatically accesses it when you do a full rest. Seeing as how I grab any and all food whenever I find some, my characters can get pretty weighed down. I erm, won't tell you how many times I've played through before figuring this out. Very minor spoiler that has nothing to do with plot: >!You do want to double check what the auto-select chooses for them to eat lest you don't want your party to wake up feeling like a bunch of hung over campers. !<
