My 24M girlfriend 29F and I have been together 2 years. I only have one tattoo. I got it when I was 19 and it was given to me by my ex girlfriend. The tattoo, while it’s not directly about or “for” my ex, she was the person to tattoo it on me. It’s a small, minimal tattoo. My ex and I never broke up. She died unexpectedly in an accident. I was 21. 

I haven’t been in a serious relationship until this one I’m in now, because I’ve taken time to overcome the loss and all the associated trauma.

To me, my tattoo holds a lot of meaning — it extends beyond the relationship I had with my ex. I’ve tried to explain that to my girlfriend but her thinking is black and white: if you’re over her, just get it removed. Can’t you do this for me? Don’t you want to move on? It means you’re stuck in the past.

These are some of her arguments.

AITAH for wanting to keep my tattoo?
