Weapon customization will be a game-changer, and many of us dream of armor customization too. But imagine something even deeper: **stratagem customization.**

Picture this—sidegrades or complete overhauls for stratagems that let you tweak how they function, adding depth and versatility to your loadout.

* **120HE Barrage:** Swap to fragmentation shells for unrivaled chaff clearing at the cost of explosive power.
* **Gas Strike:** Choose between a small, high-damage area or a wide, low-damage spread.
* **Smoke Screen:** Opt for white phosphorus—shorter smoke duration but with damage over time.
* **Flamethrower:** Toggle between a wide spray mode for higher cooking damage or liquid fire for extended range that demands precision but sticks much more. 
* **Eagle Strafing Run:** Tailor it with AP rounds or HE/Frag shells, plus the option for a wide spread or precise targeting bursts.

Think of this like the recent fire mode updates for support weapons—but scaled up to super-dreadnought levels of awesomeness.

These changes wouldn’t just be cool; they’d transform how we strategize. In the short term, with just basic adjustments to damage types, explosion radii, and penetration mechanics, developers could deliver a massive boost to Helldiver personalization without needing to use extensive resources. Saving the more game-changing options for later roadmaps.

It’s all about giving us more ways to adapt and make each loadout our own while keeping the core gameplay fresh and dynamic.
