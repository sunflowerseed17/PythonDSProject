Hey all, I'm looking at some of the preorders for the Acheron cross-body bag right now, and it seems like the bag, along with most of the impression lines, from Dan Heng to the upcoming Kafka, is completely polyester. For me, when I'm buying clothes I value quality just as much as style, as whats the point of fashion if I can only wear it once or twice?

I'm wondering if anyone here has any experience with Mihoyo's merch and its quality in general, as it sure is NOT cheap despite how stylistic a lot of their pieces are.
