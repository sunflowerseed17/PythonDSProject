Our basement has carpet directly on the concrete slab, and unsurprisingly it's moldy and gross. It came with the house like that. We are thinking of using LVP to replace it but I've heard it's not worth the hype. I dont want tile or hardwood, its too expensive. Anyone have any suggestions or guidance?
