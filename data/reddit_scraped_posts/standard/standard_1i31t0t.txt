Saw this post in r/mildyinfuriating : https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/s/eDhEgiZf9y about a heavily redacted SOW regarding USAF social media practices. Top comment (around 3.7k upvotes) says something like ‘a lot of whistleblowers are coming out now, interesting times’. Looking up whistleblowers for USAF doesn’t get me anywhere, other comments seem to be linking it to the drones over New Jersey, what am I missing?
