I rewatched Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid recently and I loved their relationship. You got the feeling that nothing would come between them and that they valued their friendship over everything. >!They even die together!<

I find a lot of movies have dramatic moments where they have to overcome some split between the leads. Sometimes it's a misunderstanding and one feels left out (think Superbad). Sometimes it's a girl (think Snack Shack). Sometimes it's money.

I just want a movie about hetero life partners (like Jay & Silent Bob) and they work together, and their friendship is never in doubt.

Sure, war movies.

I was thinking Shaun of the dead, or Hot Fuzz, but even they have moments where they doubt the friendship.

Go any suggestions?
