A little over a year ago, I was doing a run using Headless Karlach. Sadly, about a third of the way through the run, Larian patched out the ability for Headless Karlach to remain in your party. I loaded my save, and Karlach was dead on the ground, unable to be revived. Withers gave me no options to revive her either. I had worked quite hard to do all the necessary tasks to get her into my party like that, after that, I put Baldur's Gate down and moved on to other things.

Now, through the magic of the Steam database, I’ve redownloaded the version of the game right before the patch! Today, I was able to recruit Headless Karlach AND Wyll, with his infernal robes for killing Karlach. I’m happy I’ll be able to finish this run after all this time.

The "rules" of this run are:

* Karlach will remain in the party for the whole run.
* Karlach will be specced as a Tavern Brawler Barbarian who uses her own head as her thrown weapon.
* Wyll will also be in the party for the whole run.

On a slightly related note, my Tav is a Githyanki and will have as low Intelligence and Wisdom as possible. I’m thinking of using different methods to lower those stats permanently, like the creche.

Fun side notes:

* As far as I’ve found, it doesn’t mess with Wyll’s personal quest at all.
* Karlach can still wear hats, which float above her stump.
