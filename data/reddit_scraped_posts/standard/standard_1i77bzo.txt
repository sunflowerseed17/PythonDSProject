I (34f) was having dinner with my sister (28) and her bf. She was talking about something she had made and was listing off ingredients. She said the word chili pepper but pronounced chili as you do in Spanish. We don't speak Spanish and aren't Latinas. However, her bf is. So I laughed and repeated her. I found it as silly as one would find an English speaker trying to pronounce croissant in a French accent when not in France. Now she's pissed because I made fun of her and here I am thinking we all woulda found it funny. She said that she considers it a jab and that I was purposely being an AH. Now I’m wondering if I was for laughing at her choice in the moment. She wants an apology and I don’t want to. AITA for laughing at her choice of words and not wanting to apologize because it was never that deep? 

My guess is that there is something more at play here but she hasn’t brought anything up
