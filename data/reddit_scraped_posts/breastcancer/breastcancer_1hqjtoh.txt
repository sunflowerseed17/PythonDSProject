I had my surgery on 12/6 and I am still waiting for my Mammaprint results to come back. They've already rescheduled my appointments with the MO and RO from last week to next week. I am curious if it really takes 15 business days or more to get the Mammaprint back. Curious to hear about your experience on this. Thank you very much.
