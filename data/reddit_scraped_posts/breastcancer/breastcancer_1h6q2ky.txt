Today was my last Abraxene! I have 2 weeks off in which I will get an ultrasound to see how much my tumor shrunk and then on the 18th I start AC! Nervous as heck about it but im going to enjoy these next couple weeks. 

Anyone have any input on how long to space out my nausea meds? My dr is going to write a prescription for a med that is also an antipsychotic (cant remember the name). She told me to take it every evening for 5 days after my infusion and then to take my other nausea med, ondansetron, after that. 

Please let me know. Thanks!
