Lie awake thinking about my Ki 67 score. Dream about recurrence. Read studies about my subtype and risk factors. Think about dying. (It doesn't help that my newsfeed thinks I want clickbait cancer stories now. Gonna have to research in a private browser!) I finally got out and met up with friends and participated in activities and I had a good time, but I was still thinking about it. I didn't really think about it until recently, and now it's my first and last thought, plus most of the thoughts in-between. It's been 10 months since diagnosis. I assume this will pass. Will it pass?
