Anyone else here have EDS (Elher Danlos Syndrome)? I am about to start chemo and I don't feel the oncologist coordinating it understands EDS and how it complicates treatments. My breast surgeon was amazing and made a big effort to understand EDS and accommodate any delayed healing. But post-op healing I am familiar with after having 2 cesarians (for example I know if my incision is refusing to close there is a stitch stuck in there that needs to be removed and once out the incision closes nicely). But chemo is a whole new world. Where there any issues or complications during chemo from EDS that you experienced? Are there any resources you know of to educate my oncologist? Or even just to bring to any MD appointment or the ED (hospital admissions have been the worst experiences for me regarding doctors listening or even believing me)?

Edit because I can't spell and autocorrect hates me.
