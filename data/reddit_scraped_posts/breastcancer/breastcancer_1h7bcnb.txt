I have a toddler turning 2 in early February. My dream was always to have 2 kids very close in age, because that’s how I grew up and my sister and I are extremely close because of it (22 months apart). Unfortunately I was diagnosed with breast cancer earlier this year and have been battling through the treatments for the past 8 months. I have 12 more months of treatment and they recommend waiting 2 years post treatment before trying to get pregnant. By that time my daughter will be 4 going on 5 which makes me so said that even if we are able to conceive, it will be like having 2 only children. I know there’s benefits to both age gaps and not but just looking for someone to give me some good news about having a large age gap. My life isn’t panning out how I always envisioned and honestly this has been one of the most stressful parts for me with the diagnosis/treatment plan.
