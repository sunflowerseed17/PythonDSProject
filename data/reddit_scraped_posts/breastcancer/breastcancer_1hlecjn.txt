I had my Pap smear on December 9th and I have not gotten the results back from Dr yet . I’m a bit worried because last time I had one the results came back in one week. Does pathology take longer if you have a cancer diagnosis? 
Also my nurse practitioner said as long as my Pap smear is normal , I only need another Pap smear in 3 years… I thought I would need an annual exam due to my diagnosis…
I was diagnosed with BC back in October. I had my surgeries and now waiting for radiation in January. TIA
