Hi everyone, just wondering if anyone has tried IQoro to help with their sleep apnea?

I’ve been really ill for over 7 weeks with coughing , loss of voice etc etc so I haven’t been able to use my machine. During this time the apnea has got worse and I’m feeling exhausted again. 

My husband found this Swedish company that makes this device - it goes in your mouth and you pull on it. The idea is that it strengthens the muscles so that you will no longer need a cpap machine and your apnea will no longer be a problem.

He wants to buy it for me - £250 but there is a money back guarantee after 6 months if there’s no improvement. I’ve seen reviews but I thought I’d ask here in case any of you have had experience with it… 

Thank you
