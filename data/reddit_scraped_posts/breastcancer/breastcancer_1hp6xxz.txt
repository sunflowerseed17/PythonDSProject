Hello! I am new here, stumbled upon reddit while googling breast cancer things...am pleasantly surprised to have found you all.  I found the lemon sized lump on a Sundy morning shower.  Odd thing was it wasn't there when I showered on Saturday.  It's been one month since I found it and I have already, mammogrammed, ultrasounded, biopsied, received diagnosis and am scheduled for tumor board/meet the surgical team in 4 days from now.  Talk about a whirlwind.  I told my navigator that if we are going to take care of the left one, we better double check the right one, 'cuz I am not going to do this all over again in 2 years when it blows up....so now I am scheduled for a right side ultrasound because the MRI saw "nodules". Likely looking at a double mastectomy in the next month (at least that is my current assumption).

Question is....I cried when the dentist had to take out two broken wisdom teeth ( I had a full set of 32 teeth for over 30 years and was proud of them), how am I going to respond to losing both boobs?  Boobs that have always been a huge part of my being, my presence, my personality.  Right now, I'm not sad, or angry or anything.  Cried once at the thought of losing my hair.  Feeling shallow, feeling numb, feeling lost.   And now feeling like I am rambling....thanks.
