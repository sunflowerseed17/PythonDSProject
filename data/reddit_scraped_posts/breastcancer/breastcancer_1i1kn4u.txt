I’m 56 and my mum died of breast cancer when I was 10 (and she was 41). It’s been the demon following me my whole life so you think I’d be less surprised to have been diagnosed. 

I found my own lump in October and just recently got my initial biopsy results of metaplastic breast cancer.  Hormone markers still to come but I understand most metaplastic BC is triple negative. The biopsy of my lymph node isn’t back yet. 

I wanted to have a basic bitch cancer even though I was fairly sure I wouldn’t given how fast this lump grew from a clear mammogram a year prior. 

I’m scared.
