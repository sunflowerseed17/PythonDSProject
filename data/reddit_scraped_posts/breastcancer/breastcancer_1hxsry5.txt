I don’t know the thought of a mastectomy has been heartbreaking to me since the start of this but it just kills me to even think about it.
I want to have kids in the future and breastfeeding is really important to me and having only one breast feels so awful.

Apparently I was only partially reactive to the chemo and the remaining cancer is too scattered to make a lumpectomy a proper solution to ensuring I won’t have cancer anymore.
