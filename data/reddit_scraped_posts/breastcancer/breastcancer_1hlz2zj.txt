Hi All,

I had my second surgery yesterday to clear one margin(1.5mm).

My first surgery has 1.8 mm DCIS and biopsy shared 5 mm size with grade 0

My doctor said she will perform frozen analysis  during the surgery to confirm if the margins are clear or not but after surgery she said analysis failed as tissues were breaking and pathologist were not able to perform it.

Has this happened with anyone else too?

Thanks
