I have an upcoming single modified radial mastectomy surgery with SLNB. Initially, I wasn't even considering reconstruction because of all the hassle and the complications. But my surgeon keeps mentioning it. After a lot of discussion (keeping in mind that I will require radiation to the chest and the armpit), they have  narrowed it down to 3 options. 

1. Skin sparing mastectomy and immediate recon with lat dorsi flap over a silicone implant.
2. Mastectomy with flat closure and delayed recon after a year with lat dorsi flap and implant.
3. Mastectomy with flat closure and no reconstruction. 

My surgeon says if I want recon, immediate one is the best because it looks better than delayed recon. Also they can spare the breast skin and use a smaller portion of the latissmus dorsi. 

Honestly, I don't know much about the pros and cons of this procedure. I have a feeling that it's gonna mess with my body because I already have chronic back pain from severe diastasis recti and chemo has also wrecked my body. I have also read some women on this sub saying that LD flap surgery has caused them to lose sensation in their back and reduced their upper body strength. And my preference is to deal with less worries and side effects and pain than get a fake boob anyway. But I want to consider all the options I have before I decide. Did those who have a flat closure ever regret it? I could still use a prosthetic breast pad right? 
What about those who've had the LD flap surgery along with mastectomy? How has the recovery been? Were there any complications?
