I'm scheduled for a DMX on January 23. I'm trying to figure out how much time I need off for work. I thought I was told I would start around three weeks after surgery. How long after surgery did you all start radiation?

EDIT: I finished my chemo on 12/9. I did TC x 6 every three weeks. The plan was chemo, then surgery, then radiation. After that, it's pills for five years. I'm not sure what medicine that will be. That's another question for the oncologist.
