Okay so Iâ€™m still dealing with crazy billing from northwestern medicine from this clinical trial I was told was totally paid for by the sponsor (greenwhich life sciences) and I get bill after bill. Anyone at northwestern doing this trial? Any one at any other trial location? I want to compare notes. Also I hate American health isnurance!!! That is all ðŸ˜¤
