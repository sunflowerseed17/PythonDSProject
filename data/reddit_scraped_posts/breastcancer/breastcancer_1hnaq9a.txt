This is just a rant. I had surgery dec 18th. TNBC stage 2/3, grade 3. Will not be able to conclusively say what stage until pathology comes back from bilateral mastectomies later this week. When I took the bandaging off, I was at my sisters to recover. I felt like I had to hide the tears when everyone wanted to see what all they took. This was normal for my family as I had an augmentation and they mostly wanted to see. Nearly all of my family is currently or has been in the medical field. I didn't think twice about showing the sutures, but I did think twice about crying in front of them. I hate my chest today. I hated it the day of surgery. I hate that because of mine and my families medical backgrounds, it doesn't seem real. Our running joke, well, my running joke has been "better me than some lil bitch that couldn't handle it" but looking at my chest, I hate my body, I hate my twisted dark sense of humor, I hate the world for looking at me with pity, I just want to stick my tongue out at them and tell them how much they couldn't have handled my life let alone cancer. F them. 

Sorry for the rant, just having a bad night after changing my bandages.
