I was diagnosed with Stage 2B Invasive Ductal Carcinoma breast cancer at 29 years old. I found out that I was BRCA 2 + while getting staged. The cancer was on the right breast, but during chemotherapy, it spread to the left breast. I went through the AC/T chemotherapy regimen for a year followed by a double mastectomy with flat closure and sentinel lymph node dissection on my right arm. Then I had an oophorectomy. My right breast was HER 2-, but after surgery, the doctors found out that I was HER 2+ so I had to get the HP treatment for a year. My question is are there any BRCA 2 and HER 2 survivors out there. Am I a rare case? I read that the five-year prognosis is not good for me. Is that true? Does anyone know of any research about my situation?
