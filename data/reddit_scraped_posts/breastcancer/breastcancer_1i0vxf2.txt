for starters I was diagnosed with DCIS on November 20thâ€¦ I am 19 years old, turning 20 in April!

DIAGNOSIS:
Breast, left, needle core biopsy:
- Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), intermediate nuclear grade, solid and cribriform types with focal
comedonecrosis;
- Negative for invasive carcinoma;
- Receptor studies:
- Estrogen receptor: Positive (100%, 3+);
- Progesterone receptor: Positive (100%, 2 - 3+)

On the 7th I had a DMX w/ immediate implant reconstruction, since Iâ€™ve been home recovering I have received so much love and support from other women whoâ€™ve went through this before. My surgeon called and said all of my margins were CLEAR and my lymph nodes were negativeâ€¦ they removed 3 out of precaution. Thank you EVERYONE IN THIS SUBREDDIT for the advice, opinions, guidance these past few months yall have helped me tremendously from understanding my prognosis, masectomy must haves, and so much more ðŸ’—ðŸ’—

(If anyone has experienced numbness after getting lymph nodes removed please share your experience because I canâ€™t feel the upper left half of my body and I am sort of freaking out)
