1) I plan to get a wedge pillow. Can I get up from the bed, go to the toilet, and lie down on the bed myself?

2) can I clear the drain myself?

3) plan to get top with middle buttons. I can wear top and bottom myself?

4) showering questions. Plan to get shower wipes and portable bidet. Can I do all these myself? 

Anything else I should know? Tips, advice
