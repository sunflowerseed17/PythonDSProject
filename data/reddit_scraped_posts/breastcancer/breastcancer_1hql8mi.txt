I've been with my hospital for my entire cancer treatment and followup care for over 5 years. My insurance informed me about 2 months ago that they were no longer working with that hospital. I can't afford different insurance so I have to switch. I got an estimate for an upcoming scan that I hadn't cancelled yet ($1500 for a maintenance scan I get every 6 months. NOPE) so I went in to cancel it. It asked for a reason so I stated that I am unable to continue my care there due to insurance. 

The nurse that does my scheduling and answers my questions responded and said she is so sorry I am leaving and that I was a great patient and an even better person and they hope the insurance ends up renegotiating their deal next year so I can come back because they will miss me, but that she was proud to get to see me make it to my 5 year mark earlier this year.

Tears streaming down my face. I know they tend to remember the younger patients more because they normally see patients that are more than twice my age, so I stand out. But it was so nice to be told I am thought of well there. It's easy to feel like a number on a conveyor belt, but I felt very seen just now and I am so sad and scared to switch hospitals after all this time.
