Two years ago, I had a double mastectomy with flat aesthetic closure and a salpingo-oophorectomy due to my BRCA2 mutation. I'm a stage two breast cancer survivor. I've been struggling with neck pain that extends to my shoulder and occasionally radiates to my left rib cage. My oncologist suggested joint supplements since I'm on Arimidex. I am taking osteo-flex and was diagnosed with osteopenia. The orthopedic surgeon prescribed muscle relaxers, which I don't use because they make me sleepy and then referred me to physical therapy which helped a bit. I also started seeing a chiropractor but received minimal relief. A massage therapist mentioned I have forward posture syndrome. I'm feeling frustrated about my quality of life and have been told the pain might be linked to physical anxiety. Has anyone else experienced this? What can I do? I am super flat and tight on my chest.
