Iâ€™m 40f and was diagnosed on Nov. 26 2024 with BC stage 2 (2.6cm) IDC with DCIS ++-. 1 of 3 lymph node positive. I got my SMX on left side on Dec. 18 2024. I am in Canada and I met my oncologist at first time this Monday. So, she explained everything, and I will start chemotherapy on Jan. 22 because she prefers wait at least 1 month after surgery. She will do 4 rounds of TC chemo, then radiotherapy and hormone therapy for 5 years. 

I am ok with this treatment, but I donâ€™t know if I would like a second opinion or not. Sometimes I think that I need more rounds or this drugs is not enough for my case. I prefer do more than less.

Does anyone have similar treatment? How was that? How about recurrence?

Thank you so much!! ðŸ©·
