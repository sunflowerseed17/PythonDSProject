Hello All! This journey just sucks balls. I am IDC ++-, grade 2, stage 2A. I have completed 16 wks of ACT, 20 treatments of radiation, a lumpectomy and SLNB. Currently getting Lupron shots once a month, take exemestane (hope I spelled that right) daily, and am about to start Kisqali - ribociclin in about a week. Music has been my escape through out this past year and it continues to be. It helps me articulate my feelings in ways I can’t verbalize. I’m Not Okay by Jelly Roll has been a mainstay this year for me. I recently found a song - it is acoustic - called Experience by Ludovico Einaudi and wanted to share it with the group and for any who find music healing and helpful like I do. I hope it helps some of you. What songs have helped you?
