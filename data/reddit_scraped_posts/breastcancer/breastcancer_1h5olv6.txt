The desire to not want to live a terrible life is, clearly, somewhat normal - but what isn't normal is it being okay to talk about it. If you even mention a hint that life is too hard - there is panic, and judgement and sometimes even involuntary commitments ... then when someone does end their life everyone runs around talking "I didn't know" or "I wish they would have told me" ... why? In today's current climate - *why* would someone be open to talking about it?

I believe it's okay to want to end your life, and the desire to die doesn't always mean suicide and the desire to take your own life doesn't always mean actually killing oneself - and people in society should be able to talk about this, safely.
