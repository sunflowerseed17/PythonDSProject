hi all, just got diagnosed.  have been taking multiple supplements, including Maca (i stopped this) but also DIM-plus (Nature's way) to balance hormones.  it seems like evidence supports DIM as being helpful in breast cancer, but i don't know.  trying to get a clear answer on whether i should stop this, other than "stop all supplements."  thoughts?  thank you!
