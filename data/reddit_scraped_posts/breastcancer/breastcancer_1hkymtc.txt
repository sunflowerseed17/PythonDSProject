I'm not sure I believe a pillow can be "cooling" without it circulating ice or something, but looking for the material and composition that will resist roasting under my hot flashes head. Down and memory foam get really hot and hold the heat. 

Also a good mattress protector to replace my cheaper one, that won't hold as much heat. My existing one has some kind of non permeable material like vinyl. My mattress is all natural futon made of natural latex and wrapped in wool. 

I did get a silk-filled duvet and I love that. 

Two months ago my bed was a young and sexy topic and now I'm trying to solve abrupt medically-induced menopause issues and not be drenched in sweat 5 times a night ðŸ˜«

Thanks!
