Hey allâ€¦.this is my first post here, I should have known thereâ€™d be a sub for this! ðŸ˜Š

So, my GP just called to say that my biopsy done last week shows I have cancer. I have no other info. They want to look at a small third spot and will then decide on surgery. Theyâ€™ve booked me in for that on the 27thâ€¦.and Iâ€™m grasping at straws that that is good, if theyâ€™re not rushing me in tomorrow or something. 

So, here I am, seeking some advice on how to stay sane, from all you wonderful people whoâ€™ve gone through this.
