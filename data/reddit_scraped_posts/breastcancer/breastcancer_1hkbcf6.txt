Had a dmx and I’m currently flat. Had 2 surgeries in 7 days. One to do the initial dmx. And the day before yesterday to remove the implant due to necrosis. Today I feel like I have to hard rocks under my armpits. Both of them.  Is this normal? I don’t see my doctor again until Friday. Also, I feel like my left side is vibrating ( cancer side) . Any home remedies to help with the armpit pain? I only had 2 lymph nodes removed on the left side. Right side was my non cancer side. Both armpits hurt
