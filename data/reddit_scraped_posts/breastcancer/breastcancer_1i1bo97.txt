Hey everybody, I was diagnosed with stage three breast cancer. I had the cancer and my left breast and my left lymph node/under arm and Iâ€™m on my way last session of AC ðŸ˜« about to start Taxol and soon we have an appointment to figure out if I need a mastectomy or a partial. Has anybody ever opted out of a mastectomy and a partial removal?
