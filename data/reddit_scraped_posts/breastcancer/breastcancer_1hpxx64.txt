Hello,

My name is Addy. I was diagnosed back in May2024 with TNBC stage 2B grade 3. I was negative for BRCA. I finished treatment back in Nov (taxol, carbo, AC) (15 chemo sessions)and had Goldielock Masectomy this pass Dec 13th. I didn‚Äôt reach PCR clear margins and no lymph nodes involvement and the residual was very low so my oncologist stated that I would be starting Xeloda and KEYTRUDA but also signed me up for a clinical trial called BRE-409 (Datopotamab deruxtecan also called Dato-DXd). 
Today I received a call from the clinical trial that I have to do consent by tomorrow because it‚Äôs last day. A lot of thing run through my mind. Not sure if to go thru the standar of care or go with clinical trial. I read and seen video that this clinical trial has worked for some. I am going to pray to God to guide me to the correct decision. If anyone has experience with this any feedback is appreciated. 

Thank you in advance üôèüèΩ‚ù§Ô∏è
