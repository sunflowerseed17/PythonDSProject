Hi, has anyone found optimal pillows and mattress protector solutions to keep the heat and sweat down in bed when having intense hot flashes? Please share brand recommendations or links!

I'm recently in abrupt medically-induced menopause at 43 (from post-breast cancer chemo and ovarian suppression soon to be followed by estrogen blockers) and man have these hot flashes come on fast and intensely. And getting worse. Day and night. 

I'm taking evening primrose oil capsules and magnesium before bed, have a handheld fan, sleep in silk, have layers of bedding and clothes and got some good tips here here to increase phytoestrogens. 

Just need to get the pillow and mattress less roasting! Thanks for any recs.
