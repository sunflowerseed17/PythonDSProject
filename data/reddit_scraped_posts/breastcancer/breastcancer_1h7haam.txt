I have been getting treatment at Cleveland Clinic since getting diagnosed. They are one of the best, if not the best for breast cancer treatment in the country. I have not one bad thing to say about them and their treatment is beyond amazing to say the least. I just got a letter stating my insurance will no longer in network with them starting next year! I am devastated and have no idea what to do!! I still have 3 chemo infusions left, DMX with reconstruction, possible radiation, and immunotherapy until Oct! I will not seek treatment elsewhere! I fucking hate insurance and the greedy mother fuckers who could not care less about anyone's suffering!
