I'd appreciate any information from those with type of BC (HER2-positive +++) including treatments, side effects, results, etc... Thank You. 

Edit:  my Pathology Report from my 1st biopsy.  I had 2.

Immunohistochemical studies show the following results for invasive carcinoma (block A1): - Estrogen receptor (ER): LOW POSITIVE (10%, weak to moderate) - Progesterone receptor (PR): NEGATIVE (0%) - HER2: POSITIVE (3+) (>90% cells)
