Hi Everyone! This is completely random. I just picked up my AI - Exemestane - and I’m just wondering what time of day do you take it?! And, if there is a reason, why at that time? I’m considering taking it in the evening because I already take Effexor and Vitamin D in the mornings. Also, the pharmacist said to take the AI with food and I don’t eat breakfast until later in the morning - I take my pills around 7.30, but don’t eat until 9.30 or 10 so I would have to remember to take my pill with me to work and take it there.
