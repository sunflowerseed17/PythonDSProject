Has anyone had a suspicious lump biopsied after a mastectomy and it turned out to be benign? I had a mastectomy in August and felt a lump near my original cancer spot in November, plastic surgeon thought it was an internal stitch so I ignored it, then the oncology nurse thought it was a fat necrosis so I ignored it, then when I saw my oncologist last week and she felt it and she said it could be a fat necrosis but let’s do an ultrasound. So I had the ultrasound today and the radiologist said it doesn’t look like a fat necrosis and gave it a birads score of 4C. I had a ki67 of 70 so I’m scared it’s a recurrence. I was 38 at diagnosis and am 39 now with 3 small kids. I didn’t have to do chemo due to my oncotype of 14 and I’m on lupron, letrozole, and Kisqali. Just looking for similar stories of hope before my biopsy next week.
