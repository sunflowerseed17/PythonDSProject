Heading to visit 4 for Taxol/Carb and Keytruda. For the last week, I’ve been having horrible leg cramps at night from the back of my knee (actually pain there) to my ankles. I mentioned it last week when I went in and they said it can be cause by Benadryl but I’m not taking Benadryl in between visits. If there are weird side effects, I’ll have them. Between this and acid reflux I’m having a horrible time sleeping. The first two weeks I slept great - now I’m up and down and up and down all night. Ativan usually helps - but nope. Nothing is helping.
