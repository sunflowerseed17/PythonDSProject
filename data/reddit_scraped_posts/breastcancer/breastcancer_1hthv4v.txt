Hi. Recently diagnosed and started TC chemo. I had my second round on Friday. I have developed this fear of leaving my house while doing chemo. I’m so afraid I will catch something & that will take me out. My WBC was a bit on the lower spectrum of normal but still normal. 

Has anyone experienced this ? How did you handle it?

PS I was also diagnosed 12/16 and 12/27 I was already in a chemo chair. Maybe I’m having issues processing all of this too.
