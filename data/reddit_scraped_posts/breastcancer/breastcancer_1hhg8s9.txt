I’m about to take five months of FMLA. In addition to teaching, I’ve always been a freelance writer. I work for Chicago Public schools. I’m wondering if I can still freelance while I’m on medical leave? Our state that we cannot have separate employment, but does not mention anything about freelance work. I’ll only be earning 80% of my salary so I really would like to take on the work while with radiation and potential chemo for breast cancer. Any advice welcome!
