So I had 2 AC treatments, thought it felt a little smaller. Then right before the 3rd they put in a clip for my 2 tumors, one was 1.1cm the other 1.8cm. On ultra sound it looked like my tumors shrunk about 3 to 5mm after 2 ac chemos. 9
Then the 3rd ac landed me in hospital with an infection. 2 weeks antibiotics. Delayed chemo 1 week. I am on dose dense ac every 2 weeks. 
Since the biopsy/clip placement my breast and bumps feel bigger. But it hasn't gone down this time (it did 3 weeks after my first biipsy). Recent chest ct noted no lymphopathy where previously there was mildly prominant nodes. 
I'm scared now my bumps are growing? Came out softer now I feel them!! I start taxol hp next week. I feel like this chemo is killing me. I'm done my 4 now, 10% reduction on my 4th. The inflammation just feels more now. :( ugh I hate all of this. Keeping positive is hard. 
Any words of encouragement, sharing of experiences.
