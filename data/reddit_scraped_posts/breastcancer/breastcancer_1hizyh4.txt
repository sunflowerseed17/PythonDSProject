Hello!

I want to thank this community for educating me since my diagnosis in 8/2024. I admire you all so much. I created an account so I can ask a specific question.

I am Stage IA, post-unilateral mastectomy, Grade 3, 12+ foci (largest 3 mm), ER-PR-HER2+. I am 9/12 done with Taxol and 3/18 done with Herceptin.

My oncologist recommends that I take a hormone blocker for five years, despite the fact that my tumor was ER-PR-. Four of us in my dept at work were diagnosed within two months of each other. My boss had DCIS on one side and has atypia on the other and after a unilateral mastectomy for the DCIS, is taking a hormone blocker for her atypia. Another of my coworkers is Triple Negative and she is also going to take a hormone blocker for five years.

I have read articles saying that ALL women with dense breasts should take hormone blockers. My oncologist admitted that there is no evidence to suggest that I should take a hormone blocker and it would lower my risk of developing a new cancer from 4/1000 to 2/1000. Since tumors can be heterogenous, part of my tumor MIGHT have been ER+, and this is the main rationale for recommending the blocker, I guess?

I keep reading quotes from oncologists about how WELL patients tolerate these drugs, but what I hear from patients taking these drugs is pretty different. 

Of course I want to be responsible and do everything THAT MAKES SENSE to prevent recurrence but this obsession the medical field has with these blockers (for patients besides those with hormone positive breast cancers) seems more faith-based than evidence-based.

Does anyone have any thoughts about this topic? 

TLDR; Does it make sense to take a hormone blocker for a hormone negative breast cancer?
