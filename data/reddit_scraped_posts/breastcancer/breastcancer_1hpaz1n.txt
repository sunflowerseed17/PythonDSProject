I made it through AC and am on my second week of taxol. AC I was nauseous and exhausted, taxol is so much easier in that aspect. But these emotions. I can’t stop crying about anything and everything. If I’m not doing something with my brain every waking moment my brain spirals with every worst case scenario possible. I’m single and live alone with my dog and sometimes I realize that I just spent hours crying over something as small as a friend asked me how I was. I almost would rather have the physical misery of AC over this.

I have an appointment with a psychologist tomorrow and am starting group therapy in a week. But any other suggestions? Do anti depressants/anti anxiety meds help with this doom spiral/crying fits my life has become?

Edit: called the psychiatrist I met with at the start of all this and got prescribed setraline. Hoping it works!
