I read about the mouth sores and am doing the baking soda/salt rinse several times daily.  I also have a Biotin mouth rinse I use as well.  While I didn't get any mouth sores, my gums are receding on a few of the lower teeth which I was not expecting.  I did not have any teeth or periodontal issues prior.  Has anyone else experienced this?  Will it resolve?  I don't want to lose any teeth from this.
