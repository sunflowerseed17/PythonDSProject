I’m heavily thinking about not taking AI’s. My Mammaprint came back as low risk, with a 5% risk of five-year recurrence without taking AI and a 2% risk with AIs for five years. My cancer was 1a, estrogen and progesterone receptor positive, 8 mm, grade one. Lymph nodes and margins were clear. I had a partial mastectomy and radiation.

The reason I don’t want to take AIs is that I already have all of the diseases that they can exacerbate! I have osteopenia, family history of heart disease, back pain, joint pain in multiple joints from Osteo arthritis, cataracts, trigger finger in both thumbs, hot flashes that keep me up all night, Chronic vaginal pain, and vaginal infections. 

Osteoporosis terrifies me almost as much as cancer. I once took biphosphonates and wound up with a hole in my jaw, so I can never take those again. I used to sell zoledronic acid, and you couldn’t pay me to take it… People had horrendous reactions to it. Also, nothing compares to our own original, natural bone.

So I’m not sure it’s worth all of the risks of AIs in order to reduce my risk by just 3%. Also, I am 58 years old. 

Has anyone else with a low-grade cancer like this skipped AIs? How did it go for you?
