 Well, after ten years of annual mammo+us+occasional biopsies starting at 40yo, two days ago I got "Microinvasive carcinoma. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), intermediate to high nuclear grade, solid and clinging patterns, with associated necrosis and calcifications. The microinvasive carcinoma is cytologically similar to the DCIS. p63, SMMHC, and AE1/AE3 immunostains association with the DCIS as well as the microinvasion support the diagnosis of microinvasion in the DCS." Big family history: maternal grandmother and both her daughters. Good news is both my mother and aunt are still alive :). People expect me to be upset, but frankly it's just like, "oh there you are" (plus relief to have great insurance and ready access to doctors,  which I did not have six months ago). Now of course I feel weird for feeling this way.
