I have a daughter (24) living in Cincinnati and a son (22) who living in Athens. I am in Cleveland and was diagnosed in July. My son has been here since the 11, after his midterms.  He has been struggling since the diagnosis.  I told his sister I wanted one on one time with my son and to delay her visit. Yesterday I asked him to help me clean the house before his sister got here. He had a major blow up saying he is doing more than her, she isn’t being supportive, and that he sees me cry and she doesn’t. It is like he has a tally book. I told him it is not a competition. I think she is being supportive. Both are in counseling. I don’t know what to do. He is so upset with my cancer diagnosis. I think it makes it worse when he is with me. Do I ask him to stay with a friend over break and just stop in for visits?And when he comes home from college in May? Or do I force him to deal with the problem, me with cancer, and look at it head on and stay at home? His dad hasn’t been in the picture at all after our divorce 3 years ago. Just an fyi.
