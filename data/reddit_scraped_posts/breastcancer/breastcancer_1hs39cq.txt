I'm two weeks out from round 1 of TCH and I naively thought that if I got through week one that the following two weeks I would be on the upswing.  Starting in week two I have developed debilitating migraines and vision problems, which landed me in the ER. They did a CT scan and no issues, so other than taking regular Tylenol and Advil, that is all I am supposed to be doing to deal with the pain.   They aren't sure which drug is causing it, as both chemo drugs and Herceptin list headache as a side effect.  I did have loading doses though, so maybe that is making things worse?  Anyone else experience this, or have any advice?  It is making me nervous about getting in the chemo chair next week.  I do have a meeting with my oncologist on Tuesday and this will definitely be a point of discussion.
