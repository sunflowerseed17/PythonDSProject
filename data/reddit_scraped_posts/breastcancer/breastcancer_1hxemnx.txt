I was diagnosed with Invasive Ductile Carcinoma, phase 2 at the end of the year. I've been told that if you are going to have cancer, this is the best type to have and the most curable. I don't know if it has spread to my lymph nodes or not, but at my mammogram the doctor made sure to stress that I would need surgery to remove the lump. All the research tells me that if it's not in my lymph nodes it is Stage 2 (which could have 100% 5-year survivability (edited because I'm learning) if you go through the treatments).

All that being said, I feel like an imposter if I tell people I have cancer. Like this isn't serious enough to be included in the population that goes through the actual hard stuff. This is supposedly the "easy" cancer.

  
(edit) I've read every comment, and I'm so happy I've found people that get it and that were willing to share their experiences.
