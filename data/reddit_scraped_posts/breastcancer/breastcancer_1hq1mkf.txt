Massive scanxiety. My liver values spiked so we are doing a CT scan to see if it’s 1. verzenio 2. Fatty liver disease progression (thanks tamoxifen!) 3. Liver Mets 4. New primary liver cancer 

I thought I was in the clear then had these labs. I am absolutely falling apart.

DX June 2023. ++- stage 2b grade 3 IDC. ACT chemo. DMX. 28 rounds of rads. Diep flap. Tamoxifen en route to lupron, ai & verzenio which I’ve been on for 6 months. 

I feel like I’m a goner. How many times can a person go through this?
