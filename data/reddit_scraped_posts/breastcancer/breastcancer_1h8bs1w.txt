From what imaging has picked up, my tumor (++-) is small with no lymphovascular channel involvement grade 2-3, early stages. I’m hoping for the best (no changes, surprises) after the final pathology report, but I keep reading/hearing stories of how pathology after surgery ended up being a lot worst than expected. Has anyone had a “better” diagnosis or no change after final pathology? 

Surgery won’t happen until January - kind of sacred the tumor will grow by then, but I know it’s unlikely. I’m “lucky” enough to have the choice of a lumpectomy or dmx (DIEP, nipple-sparing). Waiting on genetic testing to decide. 

Just want to say thank you to everyone here! This group has helped me so much since being diagnosed, and I know will continue to be an invaluable resource. I’m sooooo sorry we’re all here but really grateful for this community 💕
