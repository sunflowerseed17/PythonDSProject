Hi all,
I have ++- IDC, diagnosed Feb. 2024. DMX to expanders in May, chemo July to September and finished 25 rounds of radiation on Nov. 5th. Been on Tamoxifen and Zoladex since Nov. 11th. 

I'm 2 months out from radiation, and thought I was all healed up and came away without any issues. For the past week or so, I've had pain and swelling right at my collarbone on my cancer side (right side). I have pain that goes from the collarbone area up my neck and also to my right armpit. I'm not really sure if it's lymph nodes that are swelling or something else. I'm scared it's cancer that's back...but I'm trying to reason with myself by saying I had a grade 1 tumour with clear margins, and it's only 2 months since finishing radiation so it shouldn't be cancer again already, right? But what else could it be? Lymphedema? Does that affect the neck and collarbone? 

I will be calling my MO in the morning but just wondering if anyone else experienced this and what did it turn out to be? Thanks in advance.
