Hi! Tnbc IIIb with micromet in 1 of 15 axillary lymph nodes removed. Post 16 rounds chemo, surgery and radiation. Now on capecitabine and 1 more immunotherapy to go.

I try not to be paranoid but I am aware of the risks of recurrence with distant Mets.

If anyone with Mets is in a space to describe how the physical aspects of the Mets felt (wherever) I would really appreciate it.

And if anyone has any comments on the almost nightly 2-3 hours of gas pain...
Simethicone is a joke.
For some reason tums seem to help. I try to avoid some things beans etc but I feel like they are sometimes not a problem...

Anyway thanks for reading, wishing you the best, and thanks in advance for your comments. I'm new to this & have never posted before.
