As a part 2 of my previous post, I finally met my surgeon and we discussed all my risk factors. He came to a conclusion that only lymph node dissection with re-excision is not possible in my case, and we have to remove all the breast tissue. So far, he suggested a single modified radial mastectomy (mostly skin-sparing) with sentinel lymph node biopsy and probably immediate reconstruction with an implant. The rest of the lymph nodes will be zapped. He said he will put up my case in a tumor board meeting today and they will decide what will be the best route of treatment for me. So I am still waiting for that. Meanwhile, I want to ask the amazing ladies on Reddit who have undergone the same surgery as I, how was the experience? I want all the details! And I also want to know if I should get a silicone implant or go flat? Will the implant cause me any complications? I don't want to put myself through more trouble, hopefully.
