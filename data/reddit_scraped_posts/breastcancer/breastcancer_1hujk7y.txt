Apologies in advance if this isn’t the right group to post this on. My mom will be taking care of me when I have my DMX in late Jan or Feb. We are both eligible for FMLA and CRFA and are both in CA. I guess here are my questions. Any advice and guidance will be immensely appreciated. 

For myself : 

1. My oncologist flat out told me she can only give me a max of 3 month of FMLA, lets say I am not physically or mentally ready to be back at work. Who do I ask for extension documentation ?? 

2. I only have little sick and vacation hours left due to having to drive far for my follow up appointments on my previous endometrial cancer. It took a while before my disability insurance started paying for a portion of my salary. My bank account took a huge hit and hasn’t recovered. Now, I have to do another one and am very worried about what’s to happen. Will I be eligible for any help from the California state ? 

For my mother : 
1. My mother is weird and I don’t really have the mental and emotional capacity to deal with her sillyness. But , she has heard that she can avoid using her sick and vacation hours and can get paid by the state through EDD. Is this true? I have been reading and asking ChatGPT and have not seen anything about it.
