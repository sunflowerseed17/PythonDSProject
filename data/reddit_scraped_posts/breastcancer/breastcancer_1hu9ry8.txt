Hi all- I am: IDC ++- , 59, post menopause Stage 1a, Grade 2, oncotype 17 so no chemo. Getting mentally ready for rads and wondering what to expect. What was your treatment plan?

Edited to add: haven’t met with radiologist yet, that’s 1/13, but MedOnc said they usually do 20 whole breast plus 5 boost and i am wondering if that’s more than usual?
