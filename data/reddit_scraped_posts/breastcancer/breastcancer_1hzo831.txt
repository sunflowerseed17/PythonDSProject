I just finished 4 rounds of AC chemo.  It kicked my body sideways.  I'm bedridden, low wbc, bone pain, nausea, high heart rate esp with walking, headaches, general unwell. You get it. Anyways, I start paclitaxol with HP on Thursday, I'm still recovering in bed. Someone tell me after AC, taxol was a bit easier? Is it the same side effects but worse, different but manageable. My body is going in very weak 
I'm doing DD Ac 4 and DD tchp x4. 
Thank you. I'm scared I'm not going to be able to do it :( 

Edit : paclitaxol not tc
