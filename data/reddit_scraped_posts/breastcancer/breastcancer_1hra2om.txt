Hello,

I have TNBC and am currently doing chemo. My sister is staying with me, and I am so thankful. She has been helping with the kids, cooking, and a great company. However, she has to go back soon.

I will be having surgery (not sure if lumpectomy or mastectomy) and radiation.

How is the recovery for surgery? How many days after lumpectomy or mastectomy will I be able to function normally? Cook, clean, take care of kids? 

What about radiation? I think in terms of energy, I think it would be better during chemo, and I should be ok without help. Is this true?

  
Thank you.
