40 yo, Stage 3, with lymph node involvement. Dense breast.

Most likely need radiation even with mastectomy. (PET scan Several hypermetabolic left supraclavicular, axillary and subpectoral lymph nodes are suspicious for nodal metastases.)

TNBC and ER+ on left breast. No genetic concerns for BC based on genetic testing.

I am thinking of getting mastectomy (to minimize local recurrence) or DMX (to also minimize risk of cancer on the 'good' breast)

Both my MO and breast surgeon think I should opt of lumpectomy (if my lump is small enough at end of treatment in Feb).

My breast surgeon even said that I am focusing on the wrong thing. The risk is distant recurrence, and not local.

I can't control risk of distant recurrence, but recurrence on breast is influenced by surgery option, and that is the decision that can be made

.Where is the best place to review the statistics risk %?

\- Local recurrence risk % of lumpectomy+radiation

\- Local recurrence risk % of mastectomy+radiation

\- Risk of new cancer on the 'good' breast given there is cancer on the other breast

Thank you!
