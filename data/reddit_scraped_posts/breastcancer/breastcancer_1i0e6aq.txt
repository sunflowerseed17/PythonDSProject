Has anyone had their TCHP (6 rounds over 3 weeks) cut short and still got PCR?  I honestly don't know how I am going to get through 6 rounds.  My mental state is taking a beating from chemo.  It may be worse than the physical side effects, which are also challenging.  I am going to ask about a dose reduction next round to see if it helps, especially if side effects are cumulative.  I just don't know how people do it.
