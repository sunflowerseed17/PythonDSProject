Having had several months of utter exhaustion, feeling like Iâ€™d been beaten up most days, I was diagnosed just before Xmas and have my lumpectomy January 28th. So, now the feeling of needing to nap and feeling like Iâ€™ve been hit with rocks is explainableâ€¦but now everything is cancer. Iâ€™ve suddenly got crazy dark rings around my eyes. Cancer? My hands are so dry and cracked itâ€™s like zombie hands. Cancer? Those weird times where both breasts ache, like pms, oh god, is that cancer in both breasts? Itâ€™s a bit like viewing life through rose tinted glasses - but now Iâ€™m viewing it through cancer glasses. Just me - or anyone else totally paranoid that itâ€™s all just cancer?? ðŸ˜‚
