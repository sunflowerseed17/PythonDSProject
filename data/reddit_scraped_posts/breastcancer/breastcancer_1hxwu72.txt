Hi guys,

Stage 3 TNBC here. I had chemo, surgery, and radiation. At surgery they found 3mm of residual cancer in the breast tissue. I have been trying the xeolda regimen but between day 3 and 5 I get really bad chest pain. I got prescribed amlodipine for chest pain but it’s not working. Has anyone else dealt with this? I’m concerned that if I don’t finish the xeloda I’m just a ticking time bomb in terms of recurrence.
