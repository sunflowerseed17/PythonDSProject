I am going to be starting my 16 sessions of radiation in about 2 weeks.  My boyfriend has a week off work in March and wanted to plan a nice relaxing vacation to Jamaica for us to celebrate me finishing treatment and to rest and relax. Based on the estimated start of radiation, the vacation would be about 5-6 weeks after my radiation finishes.  I know everyone is different as far as how bad they burn, etc.,  but do you think a beach vacation will be doable as long as I'm careful to keep that area protected from the sun or will i possibly be miserable that soon after? I have no problem sitting under an umbrella in the shade most of the time as long as I'm feeling good. A nurse i talked to warned about possibly getting irritated from a bathing suit top rubbing. Appreciate any insight and opinions from those of you that have radiation experience!
