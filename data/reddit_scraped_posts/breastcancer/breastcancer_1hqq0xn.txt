DX of BC was in February, and now I’m
a 40 singles lady in her Tamoxifen era flying solo on New Years Eve. 

I have my medical MJ card. Took my first 6.5 mg thc gummy last night; mild high that lasted through today. I really enjoyed it last night just vibing out to music, not giving a fuck about anything during a horrible year. 

So anyway, here I am alone on New Years Eve… wanting to take another edible; anyone take edibles two days in a row or advice from my veteran edible takers? 

Thanks <3
