Age 40s single lady flying solo in her lonely Tamoxifen era. I’m broke as fuck bcuz cancer shit. I wanted to travel and dream of Madrird but nope, I just get more couch time or time in my city because I am broke. 

I do normal things like work and see friends. But I barely sleep. The insomnia is bad. I take clonidine too and sometimes feel I’m going to pass out just from standing up. I work out like 6 days a week and I still can barely sleep. I get some hot flashes too at night. I’m always worried about money, dating, career, where to move to and just everything. My mom is old and sick and had BC too; I’m worried she doesn’t have much time. It’s triggering having had the same disease; tho she’s stoic and we don’t talk about it much. I don’t think I can handle going thru grief rn. I live a few hours away and the thought of visiting her is hard; she can be really mean and I just need love having been Dx’d with cancer this year.

I have a counselor yes but it’s not enough.

I am a teacher so I know not to buy weed from the street. It’s literally dangerous now. So, I’m on to medical weed; I’m not going to smoke. I want edibles or gummies. Let’s hope they don’t make me paranoid or more anxious. I just want a vacation from my mind sometimes and I want to be able to sleep. Any advice is appreciated. I have my medical week appt this weekend. Why do I feel like this is taboo to bring up with my onc? I feel like early stagers get a lot of bias and aren’t taken as seriously; like “why would you need that? You’re just early stage…”

Also, any Tamoxifen takers here on MJ!? I don’t drink alcohol anymore bcuz my BC was estrogen and progesterone positive.
