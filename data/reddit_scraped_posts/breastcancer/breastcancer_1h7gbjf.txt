Finished TC x 6 in late April and lost my remaining lashes and brows a month after - good times! They then grew back in and another 3-4 months later went through a massive shed, like 80% of my lashes and brows fell out over the course of maybe a 3-week period. Which I've read is normal and it makes sense given the fact that all the follicles get sync'ed up from chemo...

So... for those who had the same and are further out, how many times did this repeat? I'm really hoping that it will be less drastic if it happens again.... 

Also sending hugs to everyone! I'm officially more than a year out of surgery and so happy to finally not think about cancer constantly! It gets better I promise!
