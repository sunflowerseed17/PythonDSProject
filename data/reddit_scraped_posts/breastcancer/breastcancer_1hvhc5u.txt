To me, the worst part of the whole treatment emotionally was hair loss. Once, when I cut my long hair that I kept 30 years to pixie, and now, the huge shedding. I feel my soul is gradually dying with each shedding.  For the ones who identified with their hair and loved it like the way I loved mine, how did you deal with the shedding? I do cold capping and they strongly recommended me to not shave.
