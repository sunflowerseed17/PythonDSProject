I (48f) multifocal ER/PR +, Her2 - stage 2 grade 2 had an SMX with tissue expander 3 days ago. I have been rotating Tylenol and Motrin since day 1, with no narcotics, and my pain has been manageable. The problem I'm having is with fatigue. I can only be up doing stuff for a few hours, and then I feel so tired I need a nap. Did you guys feel this way after your surgeries? I just want to know if it's normal. Thank you. 
Edit: I forgot to mention that my surgeons told me to get up and walk around every hour, but I'm literally sleeping for half the day, sooo...
