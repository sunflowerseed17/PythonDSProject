Hi Breasties,

I’m looking for guidance on how to handle the side effects I’m having from Tam. I’ve been on it for around 3 months. I had to start on an anti-anxiety med to counter the horrible anxiety/borderline panic attacks I was having. Since being on both meds, I’ve gained about 10 lbs and a lot of the muscle I’ve spent the last 20 years building has turned to fat. My strength has dropped pretty significantly. I’m tired and unmotivated most of the time. My memory has gotten really bad to the point that I forget appointments or gatherings even with reminders in place. I feel like my ADHD has gotten so much worse. It’s beginning to affect my work and also I’m forgetting to take my son to his activities. 

Anyone else had similar issues? Any recommendations. 

Adding that I’ve been a bodybuilder and in really good shape for the last 20 years. Lifting heavy weights allows me to relieve stress and builds my confidence. Losing muscle mass and strength and gaining fat is making me sad and slightly depressed. I also am not a person that takes pills so adding more to the two pills I mentioned above (and supplements) is not something I’m considering.
