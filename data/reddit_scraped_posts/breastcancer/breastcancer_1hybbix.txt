Hiya lovely people

I am 14 months post chemo and most of the hair I lost has now grown back (on my scalp at least, my eyebrows sadly never made a return)

I cold capped and kept most of my hair on the back and sides, but went bald on top (very medieval monk and definitely not my sexiest era). Now the hair on top has regrown it is pretty sparse and I can see my scalp way more than I'd like. At first the hair was curly but now it's growing straight and as it's growing longer, it's looking worse. 

Anyone got any tips for making it look thicker or at least disguising the scalp a bit? I'm white with dark hair which probably makes it more noticeable. I'm also quite short so feel like most people are looking at the top of my head when they're speaking to me. Will try anything to look less Gollum-ish!
