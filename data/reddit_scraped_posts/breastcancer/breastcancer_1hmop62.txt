We’ve been estranged by our choice from my husband’s family. I haven’t seen them in over 8 yrs and my husband and kids haven’t seen them in over 6 yrs. We’ve been married for almost 20 yrs. My dad is in a nursing home, my mom passed many years ago and I’m an only child. Admittedly holidays are rather boring. My sons (16 & 17) sometimes make comments around the holidays about how weird we are because it’s literally just us 4 on Xmas. Most of their friends celebrate with lots of family but this is something that my kids haven’t gotten to experience for most of their life. It’s been hard to explain to them why we don’t have contact with my in-laws and my husband has been no help. My kids think we might be the issue because they haven’t been told the entire story. Anyway, if anyone here sometimes feels guilty about this aspect of estrangement, is there anything you tell yourself or your kids that’s helpful?  Thanks!
