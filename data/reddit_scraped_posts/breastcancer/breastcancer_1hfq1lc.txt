I'm 38 years old and was diagnosed with IDC ++- in September. I had a lumpectomy mid November and am waiting for my oncotype results to see if I need chemo, but they are speculating no chemo, just radiation and 5 years of tamoxifen. I don't have children and have been on the fence about wanting them but leaning more no than yes.  I am in a new relationship (5 months) so wasn't planning on making any decisions on that anytime soon. But now I am presented with an a choice: freeze my eggs (which will be covered by insurance due to my diagnosis) or not. In theory radiation and tamoxifen would not effect future fertility or ability to have a healthy baby I'm being told. I'm also being told don't get pregnant on tamoxifen cuz it will cause severe birth defects, but I could stop taking it for a year or two to have a baby and then start it back up with no additional risk. I'm just finding myself so torn if I should do this a preserve my options for the future (even just taking advantage of the "opportunity" in case I decide yes and have issues conceiving naturally) and ensure i have some healthy eggs from pre- treatment, or if I don't do it since I am very on the fence often leaning more towards no. I would appreciate any thoughts and advice.
