I found this free course online that talks about how to recover better after a mastectomy and it also addresses the caregivers. It is by a recovery nurse and she mentions about nutrition, drain care, pain management, movement, nausea and constipation management post surgery. I found it pretty useful and I hope those who are about to go into surgery soon find it helpful too!
