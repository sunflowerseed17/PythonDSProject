I am 52, IDC, er+ pr+.  lumpectomy, radiation and now three weeks on tamoxifen.  Wanted to give some positive news to everyone that is facing that path.  i was so worried.  my dr started me on 10 mg and I then went up to 20 mg.  The only real side effect- slightly dry mouth and metallic taste.  Period was normal, just slightly crampier.  Have some spotting.  Nothing else!!!  hoping that’s it….
