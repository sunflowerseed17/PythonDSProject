Given recent events, I feel compelled to share my perspective as a Canadian. In our healthcare system, no claim is denied, and pre-existing conditions are not a concern. I believe the US system and its supporters are influenced by propaganda against social healthcare. A system where no claim is denied is entirely possible, as evidenced by the success of social healthcare in numerous countries. I recently completed cancer treatment and was not billed a single time. I will continue to receive follow-up care for the next 5-10 years without any charges.

The concept of insurance is inherently communal. Everyone contributes to a shared pool of money, creating a safety net for those who need it. However, in the US, private companies manage this communal money, and individuals have no say in their operations. In contrast, our healthcare system is accountable to the entire population, who vote every four years. This ensures that we do not face denied care.

I am curious about the income tax rates in the US for someone earning $100K annually, including their yearly health insurance costs. I wonder if this total is comparable to the taxes we pay in Canada. If so, why not support social healthcare, which offers similar financial contributions without the risk of being denied help?
