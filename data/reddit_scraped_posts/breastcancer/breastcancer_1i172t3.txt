Hello! I have seen 2 rad oncs. Both said I am a good candidate for PBI but their treatment is different. If you had PBI would you share what you did? For context- I am 59, IDC ++-, stage 1a, grade 2, no node involvement, 2cm tumor
First doc: 5 rounds, the g’s are more than whole breast but they didn’t tell me the #. It is less radiation cumulatively. Second doc: 15 rounds, same g’s she would do for whole breast. She called it “slow and gentle” and also said that’s what she would do given my age. There is tons of data on PBI effectiveness and but it’s harder to find info on g’s and number of rounds. How was it for you?
