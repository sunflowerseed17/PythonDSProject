Hi everyone, yesterday I got back results from my lumpectomy/SNB on 12/19.  For background, I was stage 2B/grade 3 TNBC with no known lymph node involvement.  The results were no evidence of invasive cancer, but there was a small DCIS tumor (next to where the invasive one was) that was removed in surgery.  My surgeon says that this is great news and that this counts as pCR (because DCIS doesn't respond to chemo, it doesn't count for pCR).  Has anyone had this experience?  I know I should be thrilled about pCR but I'm feeling more sad/weepy instead - not sure if it is because of the extra little cancer or I'm just exhausted/a bit traumatized by a very rocky 6 months
