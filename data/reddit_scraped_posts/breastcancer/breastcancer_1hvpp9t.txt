hey girls :) 


so.. today was my oncologist appointment after 4 weeks post my first zoladex shot + 2 weeks pn exemestaneâ€¦ she wanted to know how my side effect are before she prescribes me the next  zoladex shot which is for 3 months this time.

as i was there i asked if i really need to take 2 calcium pills a day which they gave me because in the packing paper of the pills it says 1 pill per day of 500mg calcium.
but my oncologist said im young (40y) and zoladex will affect my bones so the reccomendation in cancer patients is 1000mg per day.
i also get zoledronic acid every 6 months to prevent bone loss.
all this sounds like a lot alltogether  or is it common??
