Diagnosed 3b ILC in July of 2023. Had 16 rounds of chemo, three surgeries (failed reconstruction that destroyed by body and am now flat), 24 rounds of rads, 42 physical therapy sessions due to loss of range (5 positive nodes) and now on all the meds-tamoxifen, verzenio, adderall, and Xanax. Meds to keep me alive, meds to keep me calm, meds to keep me functional. I’m 47. My question, does hope and joy ever return? I am in a constant state of rumination and worry about reoccurrence, am numb from all emotion, and can’t find anything in the future to feel hopeful about. Happily married for almost 30 years. I have worked the whole time with not one day missed. Apparently my masking abilities are on point. No one seems to know or have any clue, I already feel dead.#breastcancer, #stillhere
