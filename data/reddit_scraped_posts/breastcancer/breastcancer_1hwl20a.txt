I just finished my 16 of 25 radiation treatments and have begun to notice shoulder pain on both the treated and untreated sides and  a stiff neck on the treated side. I have been stretching since before treatment but have not been concentrating on the neck area.  Has anyone experienced these side effects and did they go away after treatment?  Thank you.
