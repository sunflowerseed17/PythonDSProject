I was afraid of doing my radiation treatments this time of year for this very reason. We're set to get up to an inch of ice and several inches of snow on top of that this weekend. How many radiation treatments can you miss before they have to start over? Sigh. Just a rant.

Edited to add: I finished 10/20 today.
