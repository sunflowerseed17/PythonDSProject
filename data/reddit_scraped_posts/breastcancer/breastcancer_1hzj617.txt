Hi gang! I was diagnosed in September TNBC, 2.8 cm, grade 3. I've been recieving NAC paclitaxel and carboplatin weekly (which will switch to EC once every three weeks), but had to stop immunotherapy when I developed a severe reaction to it which left me in hospital for several days (full body rash and hepatitis, both cleared up now). This episode meant one round of chemo was outright cancelled and another was postponed a week. 

I've had low neutrophils on two occasions as well, which means my last round of chemo is going to be 4 weeks later than originally planned and I've still got 6 rounds to go!

I really really need chemo to be over, I hate it so much. How are you all coping with delays to treatment? I've asked if filgastim could be prescribed but I'm not sure if that's only used for EC in my area. I'm switching to EC soon which is also worrying me. Any coping tips are much appreciated!
