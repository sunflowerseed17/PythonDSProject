Hi, I had breast cancer 2 years ago and had a DMX. I did not have chemo or radiation. My cancer is hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative. My onco score came back at 10 and 5 if I went on tamoxifen which I did. 3 months ago I felt a lump in my armpit which turned out to be cancer. I have to have a lung biopsy to see if its spread. I am terrified. But I wanted to ask when type of follow up should I have had? I saw my oncoclogist every 6 months. I was still getting my period. She would feel around the area and send me on my way. No scans, no blood work, nothing other than a phyical exam. Does that sound right you all?
