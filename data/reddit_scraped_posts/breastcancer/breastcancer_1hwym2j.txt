Maybe this is just my paranoia about american health insurance getting the best of me, but long story short I was diagnosed with breast cancer and I was provided with an RN case manager (not so much free as part of what I pay for), she's been pretty friendly and helpful with questions and checking in on me but I'm wary that if I say what I intend to do before my insurance gets billed for it it could somehow backfire on me? 

Not that my insurance doesn't see what I do regardless for treatment but I just can't help but wonder if there's a "catch" to something like this?
