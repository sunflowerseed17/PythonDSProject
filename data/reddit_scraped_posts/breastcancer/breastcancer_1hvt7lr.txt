Hi, I’m 29 and underwent lumpectomy, axillary node dissection, AC/T chemo, and proton radiation for right sided breast cancer (HR positive, Her2 negative) in 2022-2023. I was 26 at my diagnosis. 

Since then, everything has been fine, but I broke 5 ribs out of nowhere (no trauma, no impact, no crazy lifting) this last September (18 months after finishing radiation). I do have lymphedema, but it’s mild and well controlled. They did a PET scan and ran tests and they did not find any other cancer and my bone density was normal. They seemed like they healed normally, but now I am getting the same intense pain that I had when I broke them. They just did another xray and said nothing else was fractured, but this seems wrong to still have pain over 12 weeks after I broke them out of the blue. It is also almost 24 months since radiation and I finished treatment. Has anyone else experienced this?
