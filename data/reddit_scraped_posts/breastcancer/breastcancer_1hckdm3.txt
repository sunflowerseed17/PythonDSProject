Hi! There's a range in my high chest/mixed voice that almost immediately gives me a headache. This must be tension, but where? Also, I'm used to addressing tension manually, before I sing, and mentally, while I sing, but what technical changes can I make to how I produce sound that will cause less tension? Thank you!
