So, I met with my surgeon today to discuss my cancer and surgery needs. Seems I have invasive ductal carcinoma, ER/PR+/HER-  I’m told the HER- is good, as the HER+ is not good. They’re 99% sure there’s no lymph impact, but went over the options should that change. I have surgery booked for the 28th, and will be injected with various things ahead of that to review the lymph situation. Apparently, I’ll then have a course of radiation, but no idea what that would look like, till I meet my oncologist after surgery. 

I’m feeling exhausted - partly that my husband and I spent two days in Niagara and the walking has killed me. So, now I’m exhausted and a little anxious. My surgeon specializes in minimally invasive surgery….which has pluses and minuses - I’d be ok with having lovely perky new boobs made. 😂 I’d been fairly chill till now…and I’m still not totally losing it. But it’s a little final now. As Doris Day would say, que sera sera. 🤷🏼‍♀️

Thank you all for sharing your stories. It’s good to know I’m not alone!!
