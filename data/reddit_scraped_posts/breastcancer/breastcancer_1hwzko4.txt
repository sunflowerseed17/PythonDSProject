Always yelling and I feel like he’s looking for argument I caught him cheating 7/2023 and he was acting that same way, could he be cheating again, he never went to any of my chemotherapy sessions or radiation he always brings up his congested heart failure, chime in we have two daughters and I’m still dealing with treatment
