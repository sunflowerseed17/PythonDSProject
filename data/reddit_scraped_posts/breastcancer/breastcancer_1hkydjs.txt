I was diagnosed with invasive lobular carcinoma (stage 2A) a little over a year ago (Sept 2023). That November I had a double mastectomy, followed by reconstruction (my final surgery, to place implants, was completed in June 2024). About a year ago (December 2023), I started on two forms of treatment: injections of Zoladex (every three months) and tamoxifen (daily). I did NOT go through chemotherapy (based on Oncotype score), or radiation (not needed because all of the tissue was removed via mastectomy). 

I'm reaching out to all of you because, while I feel fortunate to not have gone through chemotherapy or radiation, I do feel tired... and my body cannot do as much as I used to. I could stand to lose 15-30 pounds, but at the end of the day, I'm pooped out. 

I'd be interested to hear from anyone and everyone... whether you went through chemo, radiation, or other forms of treatment like me. Are you tired? Does your body feel old? Will it ever get better...or is this the way life is going to be from now on?

I'm 50 years old. Prior to being diagnosed I was premenopausal, so going on Zoladex has forced me into menopause, so that is a big change for my body as well. 
And while I mentioned I could stand to lose weight, I've kept around the same weight since my diagnosis...give or take a few pounds.

Thanks for sharing your experiences. 

Take care.
