I suspect that tamoxifen is raising my systolic blood pressure. I ended up at the emergency room last night because my heart hurt. As usual for me, they did not find a problem. No blood clots, no heart damage, nothing. I took my blood pressure before I left, and it was 145/76.  

This morning I decided to not take my daily tamoxifen dose. I just took my blood pressure. It was 97/62. A bit low, but much closer to normal.  

I have messaged my oncologist about all of this. I have chronic fatigue syndrome, so (unfortunately) I am very sedentary. My cholesterol numbers are bad, and I can't tolerate statins. I mention those two things because they make taking tamoxifen more dangerous.  

I am sharing all of this for two reasons. First, y'all are nice people and we prop each other up. Second, I want to raise awareness that this is an issue, and to perhaps give some else encouragement to advocate for themselves.  

I probably won't hear back from my doctor until later in the week, it being New Year's Eve where I am. That's fine. I'll probably take the tamoxifen tomorrow morning. If my blood pressure goes up again I'll have just that much more ammunition.  

Happy New Year's, and I hope everyone has the fortitude to handle whatever this life throws at you.
