I've pretty much known since Dec. 2nd because the doctors who did the ultrasound and biopsy both told me to expect it to come back positive. My biopsy was yesterday and I've been refreshing the app all day. I shouldn't have done it but I didn't think I'd see results posted at 10:30 PM. IDC, 7cm, Nottingham grade 3. The lymph node they biopsied shows metastatic carcinoma. I think this means it's at least stage 3 from what I've googled. I don't want to wake my husband. I studiply thought I would feel better with the answer but I wish I waited.
