Hey all 👋

I finally started radiation on Tuesday, December 17, this week. I have completed 4 out of 25 treatment so far. I am curious as to when did the skin changes start for you? 

So far so good for me, but I’m waiting for the other shoe to drop. My skin care routine so far: 

1. StrataXRT cream in the morning before radiation. After radiation, apply Aloe Vera gel. 

2. Re-apply StrataXRT cream in the afternoon after a shower. Also add a layer of calendula ointment + coconut oil on top.

3. Night time: Wipe off any remaining StrataXRT as it makes a protective film. Then apply Mometasone and let it try. Then add a layer of calendula ointment + coconut oil on top. Apply Xeroform dressing all over the breast area with an ABD pad on top, and go to sleep!
