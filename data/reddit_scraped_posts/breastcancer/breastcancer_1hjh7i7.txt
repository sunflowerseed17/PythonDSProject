My last TCHP infusion was on 12/3, so I’m almost 3 week out 
Last night I started feeling really itchy before bed. Then after my shower and was in bed trying to get to sleep the itching intensified by 1000x and I become covered in hives. I took a Benadryl that knocked me out.

This morning the hives are so much worse. All over my body; mostly on my torso and thighs. Itching, burning, red hives. I’m really freaking out- I look like I have some kind of fast spreading rash! 
I went to urgent care after eating breakfast and by the time the doctor saw me (it was very busy) the hives were 90% gone and I was less itchy. 

He gave me a steroid shot and a prescription for steroid pills. Told me to take Benadryl to keep the itching under control. He never really answered what happened to me or what it was. 

Nothing is different at home except my skin care routine and I did not have the hives on my face. What did this?? Now my skin feels burnt like a bad sunburn but the rash is gone…. I have never had a reaction like this before. I’m terrified it’s going to happen again when I go to bed tonight.
