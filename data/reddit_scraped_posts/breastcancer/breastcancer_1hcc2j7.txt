Well, after 6 months of active treatment, tomorrow is the day. I am receiving my double mastectomy. I am terrified, anxious, and can't stop mourning the loss of my breast. Especially my nipples for some reason. I knew I would be sad about it, but I thought maybe I would have come to terms with it before my procedure. That didn't happen. Emotionally I am all over the place. I've never had a major surgery before and I am so afraid to be under anesthesia for an extended period of time. Part of me wants to just change my mind and say no thank you. However, leaving the cancer in my body is not an option. I am horrified of the pain and the expanders that are being placed. I also can't stop spiraling with thoughts of reoccurrence. I am a mess. Is feeling like this normal? Please tell me that this isn't going to be as bad as I think it is. I'm trying not to think of worst case scenario, but I just can't help it.
