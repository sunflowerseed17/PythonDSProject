I will have four sessions of “Chemo light “over 12 weeks and I’m wondering if I could manage that without having a port placed. I am comfortable with needle sticks and IVs in general and fear that having a port will limit my ability to do Pilates, which is an important exercise for me. any pros or cons from others experience?
