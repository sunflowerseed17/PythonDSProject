Yup I said it and I know it’s a shitty thing to say. I got into a fight with a family member and they do not understand why I’m scared. I just finished chemo and I’m about to have my first surgery in about ten days. 

2024 put me through it. I watched my dad pass from alcoholism (cirrhosis) then 4 months later get diagnosed with stage2 invasive ductal 
carcinoma. 

Any insight would be great
