To be fair it's not covered in my province, runs about 4500 but costs isn't an issue. I am on the fence if it is worth doing? My MO is indicating it doesn't really change treatment protocol in the chance of Mets. May allow for earlier detection on reoccurance but not enough to really impact treatment..she more concerned about the mental impact of the testing. She's leaving the decision to me and will support whatever I choose.

I am leaning toward doing it. I can claim it back on my taxes so again cost isn't worry..of those of you who did or didnt do it, what swayed your reasoning?
