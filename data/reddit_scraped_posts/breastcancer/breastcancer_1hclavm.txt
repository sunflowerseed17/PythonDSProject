So I’m just wondering why I need chemo and radiation if the job of the chemo as a preventative after surgery is to basically sweep any rogue cancer cells in my body. For reference Stage 1b ICD ++- grade 3, oncotype 31. I’m planning to do the 4 rounds of chemo just wondering what radiation will do that the chemo won’t. I do plan on asking my MO this question as well but wanted to hear your thoughts as well.
