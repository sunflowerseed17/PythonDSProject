hey there. i finished herceptin and perjeta maybe three weeks ago and ive found ive been vomiting more now than when i was on chemo. im trying to figure out if this is related to my infusions or my gluten intoleranceâ€¦or if my gluten intolerance has gotten worse because of my infusions. did anyone have experience getting that sick from targeted infusions?
