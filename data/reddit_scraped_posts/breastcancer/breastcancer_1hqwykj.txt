I was recently diagnosed with IDC after a core biopsy of the tumor and lymph node (both cancerous). The doctor told me the steristrips would fall off in about a week. They didn’t and I asked my PCP after 7 days if I should remove them and she said to leave them on and let them fall off naturally. It’s now been 2 weeks and they are still firmly in place. Should I take them off? Wondering if others have had this experience?
