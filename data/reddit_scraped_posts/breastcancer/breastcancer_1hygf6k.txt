I saw a sign in the waiting area while waiting for my appt this am:

“We want you to experience excellence. Please let us know how we can meet your needs.”

It made me smile. What’s that expression- ‘better to laugh than cry’? Hey breasties, we are getting through this sh*t even when the “experience” is far from excellent. My first request would be to have one portal only😊what would you ask for?
