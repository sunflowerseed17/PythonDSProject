Hi,
I had a lumpectomy during Thanksgiving week and I was healing well until my post op this week when they removed the stitches. Suddenly, the wound is draining ALL the time! It had soaked thru my bra as I got dressed and I had the doc come back in to check. He said this happens to maybe 1 in 10 patients that the wound has fluid and needs to drain. I've been thru 2 big boxes of gauze just trying to keep the wound in check. Then everything hit me at once. Getting DCIS. Talking about radiation. Having to change the gauze in my bra every 30 minutes because the wound is leaking. I'm scared. I'm tired. Has anyone else had this happen? People I knew who had lumpectomies told me how easy it was and that it wasn't a big deal. They lied!
