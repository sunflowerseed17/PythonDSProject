Ok. Last week I learned I had breast cancer at a conference for work. 

Today I saw my primary who shared everything - I learned it’s invasive ductal carcinoma, triple negative, grade 1. The spot is .7mm in my left breast. She said with this cancer - since it’s so small - I’d prob have surgery first and then figure out next steps. 

I met with the surgeon and scheduled a double mastectomy. Because as soon as I heard cancer I made up my mind I wanted them gone. 

After I met with the cancer navigator for the first time and she said - “this is the most aggressive cancer and we don’t see it triple negative with grade 1. It’s usually grade 3. So I think the oncologist will want another biopsy to confirm as normally it’s chemo first for this type”

I freaked out inside and stopped listening. Invasive doesn’t mean aggressive to me, and grade 3 sounds really bad and not having surgery first sounds very bad. She ended up calling the oncologist (I’m meeting with her Wednesday). 

The oncologist said no….for such a small spot we’ll do surgery first and then see what pathology says. 

Then my sister sent me an article from the Mayo Clinic that basically states if you’re triple negative you are going to die. Like fast. Because this type grows fast at a microscopic level and has the tendency to reoccur.

I AM FALLING APART AT 11:30 AT NIGHT. I took a shower and cried. I paced back and forth. I tried deep breathing. Imma be up all night worrying. I NEED to live for my son wtf. Is triple negative really a death sentence?
