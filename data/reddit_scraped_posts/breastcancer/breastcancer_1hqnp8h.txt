Hi all - posting on behalf of my mom who has been in remission since 2012. She had an MRI last week and was given a laundry list of things they want to look into further. (small laceration on liver, slightly inflamed lymph node, possible partial lung collapse, small spot on sternum and pelvis) Understandably, she is quite overwhelmed, and going down a dark mental path pretty fast. 


I am trying to get the lay of the land and understand what a CT scan might clarify that an MRI didn’t and what kind of answers to expect, not diagnostically speaking of course, but the sort of information a CT is looking for that an MRI didn’t supply. 
Any input is appreciated!!
