I’ve recently decided to replace my natural 2ct diamond wedding ring I lost 6 yrs ago. I’m really interested in Lab grown but I don’t know where to start. I live in Michigan and can’t seem to find places that I can see/buy in person other than Blue Nile which seems wildly overpriced according to this sub. My biggest concern is making sure the center diamond  isn’t a different color than the other diamonds in the setting and it seems it would be hard to tell something like that without seeing it in person. Are some GIA certified or all they all IGI? The price range is crazy from one online supplier to the next. I’d like to stay around 1.80-2.20 in size, VVS1 or flawless, d, e, or F color and excellent cut. Any tips or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
