I’m 55 years old with Multiple Sclerosis. Bed bound without using a hoyer to put me in my power chair. Was housebound until I finally got a wheelchair van. Needless to say I missed 3 years of mammograms being house bound. I got the results of biopsy today and I’m scared.
The results said

 invasive ductal carcinoma, at least grade 2.
Cores involved 2
Largest contiguous focus 4 mm 
Ductal carcinoma in-situ: Present nuclear grade 2, solid pattern

Lymph node Metastatic mammary carcinoma (largest contiguous focus 13 mm.

Pathologists Comment
Part A. Tumor cells are positive for MOC31.
Part B.  GATA3 immunohistochemucal stain is positive in the tumor cells. 

Any encouragement is appreciated cause I’m scared.
