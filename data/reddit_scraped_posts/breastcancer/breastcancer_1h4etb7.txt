hi all, this group is amazing.  just diagnosed last week, feels like it's been months.  i can't get off the internet.  my mammogram and MRI's show a 6 mm mass, biopsy showed IDC/ILC grade 1-2, with focus of CIS.  biomarkers still pending.   also a few other areas of enhancement in same breast (on MRI) without definite masses.  very dense breast tissue.  nodes look normal.  i have family history of breast cancer, more than i thought actually.  i am leaning toward bilateral mastectomy, praying the nodes are negative and i can avoid radiation.  i just feel like anything i can do surgically at this point to reduce my chances of recurrence is right move.  i feel like surgeon thinks this is not needed.  i understand the statistics of no improved survival.  nothing else in other breast on MRI, but i'm reading stories where something was found in other breast with DMX.  i know there are other posts about this, but i just wanted to ask about recent thoughts on this.  does anyone regret getting double mastectomy upfront? thank you everyone.
