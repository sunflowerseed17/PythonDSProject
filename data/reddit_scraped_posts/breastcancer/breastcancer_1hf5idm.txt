TL/DR is the title. You guys I was looking for the 2025 Prius to Geek out over, but can't find any info on it on the official Toyota website. Googling it, and asking Chat-GPT confirms that there IS a 2025 Prius, but it's .... not on their website????

I just hate the colors of the 2024 Prius and wanted to see if the 2025 had a better design, or better colors but this fabled 2025 Prius seems to only exist in my imagination and nowhere else..... 

  
is there any info on why the Toyota website doesn't show the 2025 Prius? Or WHEN the 2025 Prius will be added to the website?? Here's the screenshot of what I'm seeing below.

[I clicked \\"View All Vehicles\\" and only saw references to the 2024 Prius.... ](https://preview.redd.it/1l7kevznk37e1.png?width=1326&format=png&auto=webp&s=361e2bfe1b2be5a0338754fddf2464a2913a18d4)
