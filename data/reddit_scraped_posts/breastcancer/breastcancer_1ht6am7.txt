I had a dmx December 13. I’m flat right now due to some complications and will have delayed reconstruction after treatment. I feel fine. Strong, my body is recovering fine due to just being flat. My husband has always been a visual person. He loved my big breast and when I had kids he was happy when I got my implants to help my boobs look alive again. Well. After my surgery I’ve taken it upon myself to take care of him sexually by giving him blow jobs. However, I asked him if we could have sex and he said he’s not ready for it. He even told me he didn’t want to talk about it, but he doesn’t mind the blow jobs. Of course this breaks my heart. We had such a healthy sex life. Idk if me being flat is going to push him away from me. I should say, he is extremely attractive, has a hot body and towards the beginning of our relationship 10 years ago, he was unfaithful. My mind is going all over the place where I don’t want it to go. Is it normal reaction of a man?
