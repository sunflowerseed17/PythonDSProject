OSU (The James Cancer Hospital) and Anthem BCBS finally made a deal. I am so relieved I could cry. 

 The US has an awful system and I have had so many anxious days (and nights!) and I have had a lot of extra appointments trying to arrange alternative care options. 

I am grateful that it is finally worked out but mad that this was even a problem!
