Y'all!  After several weeks of waiting, I have finally got my medical team to get me necessary appointments set up.  I had my first consultation today.  Those Dr's were awesome and answered anything I threw at them.  

But now they want to schedule a diagnostic mammogram.  I have had an ultrasound and they are planning on doing an ultrasound guided biopsy.  But I have to get the baseline mammogram first.  It freaks me out which is embarrassing and makes me feel stupid.  Is it just over reaction to anxiety?

They told me just from the initial exam it is a high probability I have cancer in my left breast.  Didn't phase me.  Told me I will need a biopsy and all that.  OK, no biggie.  Then they said I need mammogram first and I immediately break into tears.

Any words of wisdom or advice for me?  I have to do this, and I will, somehow, but is there anything yall can say to help alleviate some of my anxiety?
