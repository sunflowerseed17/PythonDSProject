Hey everyone! I’m newly diagnosed TNBC, with lymph node involvement, 3 nodes specifically that were picked up on the breast  MRI. It’s been two weeks of PURE HELL!

I had my staging scans on 12/26. I’m terrified to look! I feel pretty traumatised after looking at my breast biopsy report that was uploaded to my chart 2 days prior to meeting with a doc to discuss. I was a complete mess trying to understand what everything meant.

As I sit here wanting answers and holding back the vomit. The anxiety is crippling! I could use the support and advice please. Thank you 🙏
I did write my doctor and ask if we are able to connect prior to 1/3.

What I’m most terrified about is that my cancer has spread and knowing my stage. I’m devastated thinking about chemo, losing my hair, and my breasts. I know it’ll be hard but I CAN DO IT!!! I just need to survive, come through the other side and be able to live a long and happy life. Thank you everyone!
