Hi guys. I have TNBC, which I had found out initially with a lump in my breast that continued to grow rather quickly. The size of the tumor is 3.2 cm x 2.6 cm x 2.1 cm. Those who also had a lump, what size was/is your lump to start with vs after treatment? I‚Äôm doing 4 cycles of AC first followed by 12 of TC. I‚Äôve got my second AC treatment this upcoming Friday. I got a biopsy completed to check on my lymph nodes as well and got a call from a doctor (not my oncologist, but I think a radiologist) stating that my lymph nodes came out benign but he would still recommend them to be removed when it comes to surgery after chemo treatment is over due to my ‚Äúextremely large‚Äù breast mass. Him calling it extremely large threw me off because I thought the tumor was considered intermediate as a T2 tumor as stated by my oncologist prior to this phone call. I know it doesn‚Äôt necessarily matter since I‚Äôm getting treatment but everything seems to bother and scare me now so I‚Äôm just here to ask those who had a lump about their personal experience and what size did you start with before starting treatment (and when you ended if achieved PCR or not as well). ü•≤ Wishing the best for everyone dealing with this too, wish we weren‚Äôt in this position.
