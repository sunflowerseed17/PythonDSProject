Hi all. I’m at the very beginning of diagnosis. I’m on the waiting period to figure out what my treatment is going to be. I have my first consults next week: surgeon, oncology, and radiation oncology along with a lymph node biopsy. What questions should I be asking of all of these specialists? I need a list as I know nothing. FYI, 49 yo with IDC single borderline lymph node (thus the biopsy), ER+, PR minimally +, HER2-, grade 1 for now. Thank you!
