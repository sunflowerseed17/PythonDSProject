The mass in my breast biopsy came back as Her2- but the lymph node came back as Her2+. My oncologist had further testing done and the tumor in my breast is both, what they call a “heterogeneous tumor.” I was just wondering if anyone else had this. 
I am currently doing chemo, as they are treating it as Her2 +.
