Does it make you hungry? This morning I woke up with a starving feeling but decided to drink water instead of eating 6am 10 minutes later I vomit, has this happened to anyone else??? And to top it off I get soo itchy and scratchy I was prescribed 2 little tubes of hydrocortisone  I get super red if I slightly scratch any part of my skin , I want to go back to tamaxofin I had no issues with that medication at all!
