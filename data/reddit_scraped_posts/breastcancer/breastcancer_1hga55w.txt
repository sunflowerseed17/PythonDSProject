My first chemo this week will be TCH (no P this round until I get insurance coverage).  My doctor has said no supplements other than the Vitamin D which I am already on.  I've read that some folks take Vitamin B6 for neuropathy and alpha lipoic acid.  I am confused around what can be taken/not taken during chemo.  What is your experience?
