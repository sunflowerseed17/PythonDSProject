My drain finally came out today ðŸŽ‰ Now I can see my chest without all that extra stuff in and around it. There is a slight crater where my breast used to be and a ridge around the former circumference. I'm not crazy about it and have reached out to my surgeon to ask if there are cosmetic improvements that I could pursue. The scar is also in a downturned orientation that I don't like. I was told it would he horizontal and it's not.

Has anyone on here had additional surgeries to fill in/contour the chest wall after AFC? Or had a scar revised? TIA!
