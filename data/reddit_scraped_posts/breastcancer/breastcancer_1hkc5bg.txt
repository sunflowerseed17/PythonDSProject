Hi all!

Finished my last chemo about 3/4 weeks ago, scheduled to have surgery in a few weeks.

Im 29, my dx is er+, about a stage 1/2 (haven't been staged..this is from my own guestimate). No spread, nodes are clear.

I've put on about 20lbs during chemo.

I'm getting TERRIBLE lower back pain when standing and my legs are aching and swollen. I'm guessing this is a mixture from the treatment, weight gain and having little movement over the last 5 months.

Anyone else experience this and how did you manage it? I need to get some deep cleaning done now I'm done with chemo as I live alone and haven't been able to do much. But every time I try to do something, I'm unable to and have to sit down ðŸ˜­
