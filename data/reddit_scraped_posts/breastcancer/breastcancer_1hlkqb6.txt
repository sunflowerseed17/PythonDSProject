Had a DMX November 4. My cancerboob has been a real pain in the ass the entire time. Pain, incision issues, just a real diva. I’ve been having some localized pain where the lump used to be (kind of like phantom pain I suppose?) but now when I touch it there’s a palpable lump. And yes, the likelihood of something growing back in 8 weeks to the point I could feel it is, if not, zero, pretty darn close. It has to be scar tissue and regular post op lumps and bumps I was told to expect. But this voice in my brain telling me the tumor has regrown will not shut up. Ugh. Will this ever stop? I have an appointment with my MO in 2 weeks so I’ll definitely show it to her but every ache and pain I have now I’m immediately like, “well, it’s cancer” it’s exhausting.
