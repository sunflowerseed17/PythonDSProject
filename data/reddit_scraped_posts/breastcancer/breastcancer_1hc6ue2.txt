I feel like I post on here too often, but I gotta get my thoughts and questions out of my brain haha.

I'm getting a 25% reduction to my T and C at the next infusion. This is the first reduction in my treatment. I know people say that they notice a difference in side effects. What is it that is noticeable? Less nausea? Less fatigue? Your numbers didn't tank as much? 

This will be number 4 for me and I've had a 5 week break since the last infusion due to crappy blood counts, so I've had a little more time to recover.
