I'm about 5/6 weeks out of chemo. 4 EC and 4 Docetaxel. Only pain I had really was pain with the filgrastim injections.

But now I HURT. Everywhere there's a muscle. It feels like I've been to the gym and overdone it on every weight machine ðŸ˜‚ I thought I was done with side effects and was so excited to be done with chemo, now I'm getting other stuff pop up? Anyone else had this after chemo? My legs and feet also swelled up..slowly going down now..plus neuropathy in my hands...the things we have to put ourselves through. We should get an award
