Feeling like a Scrooge this year. I’ve made it through active treatment and I’m waiting for next steps with my MO and to start the meds. But I’m in 0 Christmas spirit. I don’t have a tree. I’ve bought no presents. I don’t want to bake, or listen to music or watch Christmas movies. I live alone. I have some family in the area but I don’t even want to see them. I just want to be alone even tho that just heightens how lonely I feel. It all makes me feel selfish and broken. Anyone else feeling something like this this year?
