How often are you being referred for imaging (mammogram, CT scan, etc) following treatment? I was diagnosed with triple positive breast cancer Dec 2023 and Iâ€™m still undergoing Herceptin and Perjeta targeted treatment. I completed 16 rounds of chemo in June and has a unilateral mastectomy last July. My oncologist ordered a CT scan in October and I am scheduled for my annual mammogram next month. My oncologist informed me that I will not be referred for CT scans as often as I thought because it is not common practice unless there is a concern of course. I feel uncertain about the future and anxious whenever I experience any little pain so I guess I just want to make sure im being checked enough.
