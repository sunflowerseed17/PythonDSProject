I'm 2 weeks into cycle 1 of weekly paclitaxel and three weekly carbon and pembrolizumab (keynote 522)

It's only the beginning and I am very very not ok. I think I had a particularly rocky start (I am too fatigued to work or drive which feels terrifying to me )

I'm scared I'm not dealing with this very well and I don't know how to do better. Trying to do short walks everyday and eating and hydrating and stuff.

Have cancer psychologist who is urging me to ask for a dose adjustment and a plan to talk to MO but I'm scared adjusting the dose will make the chemo not work. 

I feel like a very small child. Vulnerable and weak
