I’m on day 5 post first TC chemo and I don’t feel strong enough to do 3 more. I’ve reached out to my care team. My heart is always racing, my anxiety is awful even with Ativan. I tried lexapro it made me super sick. I woke up this morning and thought it was gonna be an all right day was able to take a shower and sat down in front of my computer to work and then I just started crashing. Everything started hurting. I’m exhausted I’m hungry but I can’t eat because mentally I’m losing my shit.  I feel angry and scared. Fuck you cancer.
