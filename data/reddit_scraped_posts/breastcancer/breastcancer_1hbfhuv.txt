I was still on the younger side when the first Chicken Run came out and I enjoyed it a lot. Now that I have a toddler, the sequel came out. 

Ginger is the leader of the chickens, brave and compassionate, smart and articulate. Rocky fell I love with her in the first, he's kinda lazy and selfish, but she inspires him to do the right thing when it becomes crucial.

They had a girl. She's a handful. She's fearless. Keeping her safe is hard work. I suspect the parenting duties aren't evenly distributed. There's a little remark about how he never works (except for singing the morning cock-a-doodle-doo). Ginger asks him to keep an eye on their kid because she has to lead a meeting and he tells her something that was supposed to remain secret. I doubt he was a more efficient parent when they had a toddler.

Also, they have to keep their village hidden from the humans. They live with limited resources. 

So, it makes a lot of sense for Ginger to chose OAD. She's enjoyed her motherhood, her activistism, and it allows to tolerate the flaws of her partner. Her teen kid is smart, sociable, empathic.

I find this portrayal to be refreshingly positive, without needing them to be a picture perfect family.

I read the post about Sofia Vergara a couple of days ago and I enjoyed it. So I thought it would be nice to share this.

PD: the song "My Sweet Baby" by Paloma Faith is lovely
