Hi everyone.
I went to the ER for chest pain and got a ct scan of my chest just to find out I have a 4 mm nodule on my right lung..I have to follow up with my oncologist..
Anyone with history of Mets to lungs? I know I shouldnâ€™t think of the worst..but my mind wonders anyway.

History - IDC right breast, lymph node involvement, her2 only.
