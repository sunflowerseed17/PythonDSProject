I had my 3rd round of TC tx for TNBC. Within 5 mins at rate of 280 I almost fainted, felt flushed and like a brick is on my chest that I can’t breath. I also had floaters on my right eye. They already gave me Benadryl and Pepcid prior to tx because this happened on my second tx. I was then hydrated for 30 mins then they restarted at lower rate and titrated it to 280 ml. 
On second tx they run the taxotere at 280 ml/ hr and within mins I can’t breathe, with chest discomfort and felt “flushed “. They had to stop it, hydrate me for an hour, gave me Pepcid and Benadryl which helped. They then gradually titrated the dose thus I was able to compete tx. 
Plan for my 4th and last tx is still premedication again w Benadryl and Pepcid then start at low rate and titrate it up. 
Posting this for those who will be taking this tx and so you can anticipate. I know we all have different reactions to meds but this can happen to you. Better be prepared. It was too bad that I almost fainted. Now I am looking forward yo what I call 10 days of suffering post treatment. That’s how long the other side effects last and for you to battle it: severe body aches, nausea, weakness, fatigue, loss of taste (yes, everything tasted awful but I still eat!), I also get easily winded with HR going up with slight activities. Nevertheless, I still try to go for a walk to keep me active. One more treatment left! Then radiation to follow.
