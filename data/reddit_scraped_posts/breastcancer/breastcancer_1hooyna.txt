I try to make an eco-friendly change in our household every year as a New Year’s resolution that is actually achievable. I’d like this year’s change to be moving away from paper napkins and paper towels. We have towel loads getting washed at least 1-2 times every week anyways, so I feel like tossing these in those loads will make a good dent in the amount of trash we make without adding much inconvenience to our daily lives. What are your favorite brands? I’m looking for soft (we wipe a lot of kid faces), absorbent, and durable. Pretend price isn’t a factor; it kind of is, but if they’re poor quality, we won’t use them, so that defeats the purpose.
