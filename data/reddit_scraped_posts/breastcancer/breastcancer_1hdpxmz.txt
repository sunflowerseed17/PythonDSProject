I just had round 3 of 6 TCHP on Tuesday. Today I canâ€™t stop burping, and itâ€™s been causing really bad nausea for about 12 hours now. The nausea is relieved by burping, but immediately comes back -  like a continuous need to burp. I didnâ€™t have this the first 2 rounds. Zofran hasnâ€™t helped, took Pepto tabs and that hasnâ€™t helped. Is this kind of nausea even from the chemo, and is there anything I can do? ðŸ¤¢
