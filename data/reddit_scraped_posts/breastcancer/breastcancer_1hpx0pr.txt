I have stage 1a breast cancer and wanted a bone scan to double check sore ribs.  Did not expect them to call me just now and say they see something suspicious in my brain.  My oncologist said it is most likely nothing,  but that it could possibly be cancer is making me spiral so bad.  I wanted this all behind me.
