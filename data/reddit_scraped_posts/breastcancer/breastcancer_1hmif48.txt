This is what it says. I have a 16 month old and 11 year old and all I can think of is the worst. Anyone have something similar ease my thoughts. So far based of mammogram and ultrasound no signs in lymph nodes but I know that can change with mri. I am already thinking a double mastectomy just so it’s all gone and ease my stress I know I’m jumping ahead here. Also any suggestions on how to talk to my tween? We have always been open and honest with each other but I’m thinking I not say anything to her until a plan is in place as well.
