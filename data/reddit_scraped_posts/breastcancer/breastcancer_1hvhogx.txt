Update: went really well. Hardly any pain still - 6 hrs later. It’s all really numb still. The preliminary margins look good and doc doesn’t think I’ll need radiation!

Wish me well with great margins. I’ll only have an acquaintance there. Wife is really sick and in heart failure still. Hoping I don’t catch something and bring it home to her.  See ya on the other side.
