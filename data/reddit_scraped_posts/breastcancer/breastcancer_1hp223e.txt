I've had so much time to think about my lifestyle since my diagnosis (+++). I'm spending a lot of time reading and researching nutrition, clean living, etc. I spent this morning using an app called Yuka and scanning all the food and cosmetics I have...so many carcinogenic items that I've been using for years. I'm really starting to blame myself for getting cancer. One thing that really jumped out was all my Bath and Body and Victoria Secret body care I've been using since I was a teenager. They are filled with endocrine disruptors and the parabens that used to be in them (they've stopped using them this past year) are related to hormone positive breast cancers. I can't turn back time, but I wish I made better choices. I know there's way more to cancer development, but that could be one piece of the shitty titty puzzle.
