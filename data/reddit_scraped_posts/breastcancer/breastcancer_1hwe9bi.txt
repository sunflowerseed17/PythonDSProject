Hi, wondering if anyone has leads for reconstruction-minded surgeons for male breast cancer?  The first surgeon I saw is local but is not reconstruction-minded and wanted to remove the nipple areola complex.  I was referred to a university for a reconstruction-minded consult and was told that they could probably do an initial surgery that would preserve the nipple areola complex and obviate any subsequent need for reconstruction.  I can't go with them for other logistical reasons.  I had a consult with a surgeon yesterday that was so weird it was surreal.  I'm hoping to get more viable leads.  I will ask in the HISbreastcancer FB group too.  I'm on the US West Coast.
