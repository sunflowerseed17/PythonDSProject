ETA: thanks everyone for the replies! I should have mentioned that I have not started chemo yet. I saw my MO Tuesday and asked her about it, and she gave me her blessing. I’ve already had surgery, my chemo and immunotherapy are happening after the fact. This evening I went to a professional piercing shop, and they were able to see the scar tissue left behind from the holes I had as a kid that I thought had closed up. It turns out they didn’t, and my piercer was able to use a tool to reopen them and get new studs into them. There was no blood, there is no open wound that will need to heal. So it was kind of the best case scenario, where I get my ears pierced and won’t have any trouble removing them for rads if needed. Thanks for all the feedback!

Can you keep stud earrings in your ears while you are getting radiation, or do you have to take them out?

Backstory: I’m about to begin chemo and go bald, so I wanted to get my ears pierced as, I don’t know, a way to still feel feminine? I plan on going to a piercing parlor, and they state that the studs need to stay in for 6 months to fully heal. My radiation will start in late April, early May. I’m sure if I just went to a mall and let some store use a gun to do it, they’d tell me I was good to go in 3-6 weeks, but I want to have professionals do it. I don’t want to ask them about possibly taking the studs out a bit early, if it turns out I will be able to keep them in through radiation. So I thought I’d ask others what they had to do. TIA!
