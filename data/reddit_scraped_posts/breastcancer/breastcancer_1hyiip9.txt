I don’t know how I’m gonna get through chemo. I had my first infusion this week of four rounds of TC. I have severe health anxiety. I am so triggered by bodily sensations. I don’t know what is something to be worried about and when it’s not something to be worried about. I’m already getting antibiotics for what is probably a UTI. I feel paranoid all the time. I don’t know how to mentally decipher what’s normal and what’s not and I’m just spiraling all the time. I don’t want to do this.  I feel like I have an ax swinging over my head. Just terrified of all the side effects and possibilities.
