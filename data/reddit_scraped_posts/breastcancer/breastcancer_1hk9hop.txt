Hi all,

So my lumpectomy/node removal was last Friday 12/13, so far its been manageable, my breast incision hasn't really bugged me but my axillary node incision has been a major pain :(

In addition to the lifting restriction I mainly have to be careful about reaching for things, or I feel some nerve pain in my bicep (reached down to turn on the christmas tree lights the other day and ouchie)

But one area is baffing me a bit, my forearm. I have pain if I press the skin, like aching/sore kind of pain, as if it was badly bruised. Nothing visible on the skin though. Anyone have anything similar happen?
