Female, 66, started on "O" June 1, 2024 at 212,  now 160. I try not to go over 1200 cal but never below 1000.  I have not had any side effects. I started at .25 and my doctor gradually increased it to 2.

I found out Wednesday that I  have breast cancer.  I'm going to still watch what I eat,  exercise when I can, and do Ozempic.  I will listen to my doctors and their guidance. 

Life does throw us curve balls.
