Has anyone changed their radiation oncologist after simulation?

I had mine this week and it had honestly made me more terrified to continue with receiving radiation from this institution. I feel like a lot of what I was told from my initial consultation changed during follow up before simulation. The simulation experience was also awful. The two techs just bickered with each other as they moved me around and marked me up so I would be in position. I also had to keep holding my breath constantly and they kept saying the machine showed I let go of my breath even when I didn’t. I was there for almost 2 and a half hours that day and they didn’t fill me with much confidence. Plus they said the location I wanted to get treatment done couldn’t do the breath hold technique so I had to travel further asay. Also I was told it would be quick appointments and I could schedule them anytime of day before. When I last talked to them they said 1 hour appointments and that they don’t have late afternoon appointments right now and I can’t even schedule until they get insurance approval which takes 7-10 business days. I still work full time and this is kind of unacceptable to me but I’m kind of stuck cause I need radiation. I have an appt with another rad onc on Tuesday but not sure I want to go through this whole process again or if it’s even possible. Plus waiting longer to start may not be the best idea since I had my last chemo on Dec 11 and the one node they removed during surgery was positive for a macromet.

Please share your thoughts with me. I appreciate everyone on this sub and thank you in advance for your advice.
