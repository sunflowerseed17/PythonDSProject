Looking for some levity today as I procrastinate about grading short stories. What are some of your quirks as a teacher? 

I'm organized everywhere except my desk, which looks like a total mess, but I know where everything is. If my desk is clean, my life is a mess.

Another thing is that I have to write things down to spell them. Kids ask me how to spell stuff all the time, and I can't do it verbally. I have to write it on the board. At the end of the day, there will be a random list of words that kids have asked me to spell. My last class of the day tries to make a sentence using all the words. So far today I have dilemma, excited, and vinegar. When other adults visit my room they always ask about it.
