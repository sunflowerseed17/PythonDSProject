Winter solstice question 

Hi ðŸ‘‹ Hope everyone is doing well tonight. 

Winter Solstice is my brotherâ€™s favorite Lunar holiday. He passed away and is buried on his property. 

I am planning on celebrating the solstice with him. I have bought lights, and mistletoe, usually he does the 4 direction prayer. I have him on video doing it. 

Is it okay for me to play the video and say the prayer along with him? 

I was also wondering if I can call on Uni, I know she is not usually involved in winter solstice, but I feel I need her in order to stay strong enough to honor my brother with a wonderful winter solstice. 

I was also going to do our usual offerings from our family Grimoire. 

If anyone else has any ideas on how to celebrate with my brother, Iâ€™m open to all ideas. Thank you
