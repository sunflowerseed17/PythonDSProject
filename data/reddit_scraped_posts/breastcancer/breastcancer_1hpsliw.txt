My pores are big and are more visible with my makeup on. I’m on a tight budget and don’t spend much on beauty supplies or on myself in general. I have blemishes too and am not comfortable leaving the house without makeup on. I usually just wear foundation and prefer a more natural look, but hate my blemishes and giant pores. I have combination skin and am on hormone blockers for the next 5 years for breast cancer if that makes a difference. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated! Thank you!
