So im 23 and was diagnosed @ 22 about 3 months ago I’ve completed my rounds of the red devil and now taking taxol it’s been 3 weeks so far I go in for chemo every Friday. At first I had no reaction but I thought I had a yeast infection was prescribed steroid cream (didn’t help) so then I was given diflucan I’m noticing this is not yeast this is a full blown rash that has traveled from the creases of my vaginal lips all the way up my ASS :/. Has any one gone through this ? I’m nervous everything makes me nervous. All though I looked up stuff and it says taxol can cause rashing but then pops up vulvar cancer I’m scared (currently in urgent care)
