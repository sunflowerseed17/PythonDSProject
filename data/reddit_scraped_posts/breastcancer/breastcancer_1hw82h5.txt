So, my 6 month follow up with my oncologist today wasn’t great. I’ve been having some hip pain he doesn’t like so I’m getting a PET scan later this month if my insurance approves it. I was diagnosed with TNBC in June 2023, did 6 months of chemo, lumpectomy, a month of radiation, and had my last immunotherapy infusion in July 2024. The hip pain started in November and was very mild at first but has gotten progressively worse. I’ve told my husband and sister but in all honesty, this cancer thing upsets them and I find myself having to actually comfort them, so
I’ve downplayed my concerns and I’m keeping my concern and fear to myself. I’m not seeking anything other than a chance to vent a bit to folks who understand.
