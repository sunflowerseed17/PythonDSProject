I'm having anxiety attacks and I can not sleep. I don't know what to do. I'm looking for guidance here. My docs have said make a decision by considering risk/benefit though have not articulated the risk/benefit to me. 

  
Diagnosis:

I am 50, near menopausal. I had a lumpectomy 10 wks ago. I have DCIS (15mm) that is solid and cribriform, Intermediate grade. I also have microinvasion (ER+, 0.17 mm). The microinvasion is PR and HER2+ unknown as there was not enough tissue for pathology). I have an extensive intraductal component. LVI - negative. My sentinel lymph node biopsy came back negative. I'm BIRADS D, even on MRI there is severe BPE thus reducing sensitivity of the study.

I am supposed to have radiation (partial breast). My fear is the 1/1000 chance of the sarcoma risk. 1/1000 chance is not rare, it is uncommon. As a comparison, there is a 5/100000 chance myocarditis from covid vaccine (now that is rare). Sarcoma has a poor prognosis and extremely low survival, worse than Stage IV BC I think?  The sarcoma adverse event is higher for those who had lumpectomy + lymph node dissection.

Optionally I could get a mastectomy. What I read is the massive wound healing could lower the immune system and allow cancer bad boys to re-awaken, thus increasing the chance of metastasis Â [https://www.news-medical.net/news/20180412/Breast-cancers-more-likely-to-spread-after-surgery-finds-study.aspx](https://www.news-medical.net/news/20180412/Breast-cancers-more-likely-to-spread-after-surgery-finds-study.aspx)[https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.aan3464?rss=1](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.aan3464?rss=1)

There are residual microscopic cells in my breast right now from the lumpectomy (supposed to be irradiated soon). I'm worried the surgery might stir them up and travel into the bloodstream and spread.

I'm also worried that with microinvasion and higher risk of recurrence, I may end up with invasive cancer post mastectomy in the chest wall or late stage. See [study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8019411/)

What is the risk/benefit here? My doctors just tell me to make up my mind. 

I can't sleep at night. I'm having panic attacks. Mastectomy recurrence risk 5% per my doc. How common is it clinically for patients at my age (50, perimenopausal) to have a recurrence and then late stage outcomes?

I don't understand with my pathology if it's safe for me to just take Baby Tam and forget radiation or mastectomy.

Please,please share your thoughts. I feel like I'm in a pigeonhole and any fresh thoughts really help.

Thank you
