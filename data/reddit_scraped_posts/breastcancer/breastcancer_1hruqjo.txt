Hi everyone and happy new year!

I went through active treatment last year for Stage I +++ IDC (lumpectomy in January, chemo from March to May and rads in July) and now I'm doing my last shots of Herceptin (only two more!!) and taking my daily Tamoxifen for 4 more years. So yeah I did and I am doing everything by the book.

In the midst of this very strange year, my sister in law was also diagnosed with BC. She had a Stage 0 DCIS and underwent surgery in April and did 5 sessions of radiation in July. Her doctor also recommend Tamoxifen but he wasn't as adamant as my doctors, I think. For her, from what she told me, it felt to me it was more of an option. And I think that because of that, she hasn't started it.

I don't want kids so taking the medication was a no brainer for me, but she is not sure yet, so this is playing a part. She thought about freezing her eggs, but I think she is stalling. She also isn't a nerd like me and didn't learn everything she could about BC in 2024. It almost became my favorite subject last year, and I know a lot of you will relate, but she isn't like that and wants to move on, I think. Also fair! But now we are in another year and she still hasn't made up her mind and I'm worried.

I don't like to bring this subject up with her because if she was given a choice, I don't want to project, every case is different. But every time I think about this I get anxious. I just want her to be ok! What do you guys think? I'm 39 and she is 36, btw. 


Edit: Thank you all for your outputs! They really helped me seeing her option differently!
