So, as I was making my follow up appointment with my plastic surgeon for one month after my last chemo session, the nice office lady says, so it shows your new insurance as not active…

Me:  wtf?

Looking it up on the app and online and all evidence of my plan is gone on them.  Even healthcare.gov is all, you need to complete your application and enroll for February 1 coverage by Jan 15.  Motherfucker I did this already!  I downloaded the digital id card, I have all the emails and letters acknowledging payment and the start of my new plan….  

I have my final session tomorrow and they don’t have me as having insurance now?  I’m so fucking stressed by this.  I’m obviously not skipping this appointment, but fuck me and my bank account, I guess?  Been on hold 25 min so far to talk to someone.

And here I was thinking of celebrating the new year…

Anyone else having issues with BCBSTX?
