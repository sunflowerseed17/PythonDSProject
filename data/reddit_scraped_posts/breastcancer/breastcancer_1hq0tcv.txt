38 yo, no genetic markers, 2.3 cm mass in right breast diagnosed in September. Started TCHP in early October. I‚Äôve completed 3x TCHP and 1x THP with 2 infusions left. The Carbo was pulled from my last treatment due to worsening tinnitus and mild hearing loss on the ototoxic hearing test.

The stats I see are for post / completion of neoadjuvent TCHP with PCR for 65% of +++ patients. My bc is strongly HER2+ (11.67 fish ratio) but super low ki67 (7%). My results (again, I‚Äôm 2/3rds through treatment) are showing just a 25% reduction in tumor size from 23mm to 18mm.

Is there any hope of getting pCR?
Why the F would my MO have ordered a breast MRI before the completion of treatment? All I got from her assistant was ‚Äúit helps us determine how we should proceed with your treatments since we‚Äôre not going to give you carboplatin anymore‚Äù

Any ideas what this means? I‚Äôve scoured the internet and see nothing about replacing carboplatin with something else.

I‚Äôve sent my MO a bunch of messages but she‚Äôs on vacation until Friday üò≠. Appreciate any personal anecdotes or knowledge people can share!
