Had biopsy on 12/11. Diagnosis around 12/16. I feel like everything is moving sooo slow. TNBC (well low PR+, but oncologist says she will treat it as triple negative).  Small tumor - MRI shows it around 1.6 cm. Surgery will be first but I feel like I cannot schedule that until the genetic testing comes back. That was sent off Thursday. My preference is to do lumpectomy on the affected breast, but if genetic info comes back positive maybe I would decide DMX. I just donâ€™t know. The genetic counselor says even if it comes back positive I donâ€™t have to choose mastectomy - I will have screenings every 6 months. I donâ€™t know which end is up over here - the waiting is so painful. I just want to get surgery scheduled. Wondering if I should
just schedule the lumpectomy and deal with the results of my genes when that time comes? It may take 2 weeks to get that back, and then the surgery would be scheduled. Who knows how far out that would be. Just a nervous over-thinker over here ðŸ˜‚. Someone just tell me what to do!
