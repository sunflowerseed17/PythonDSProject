For context. 36 IDC ++- 19mm Grade 2 No Nodes Oncotype 13. 

I’m grateful I didn’t have to go through chemotherapy. 

I’m just tired of the “options” given to me at follow-ups when in reality my team feels I should do something different. I love my team but I just want to be told what to do to give me the best chance of never having to deal with this again. 

After my successful lumpectomy and SLNB I went for my follow up with my medical oncologist and she said I have two options. She’s comfortable doing just tamoxifen for probably 10 years. She followed this up with studies that suggest OS+AI could be more beneficial in the long run and I would only have to do this for 5 years. I agreed to try the OS+AI. I was actually put in a trial where I’ll get my Lupron every 3 months instead of monthly. 

Then yesterday I had my follow up with my radiation oncologist to talk about my radiation plan. The “options” given are dependent on if we can see my tumor bed in the scan. My tumor was in a tough spot for breast conserving surgery so I had to have oncoplastic reduction and this can make it difficult sometimes to see the tumor bed in the scan. If we do see the tumor bed she said I can choose partial breast radiation. Only 5 sessions. She then followed it up with textbook says 15 sessions of whole breast radiation and 4 boost (if we can see tumor bed) could be more beneficial for my stats. I decided to go the whole breast radiation route. 

I’m just sitting here thinking how I would much rather go the Tam and partial breast route. I also know I’ll follow my team’s suggestions. 

Happy New Year!
