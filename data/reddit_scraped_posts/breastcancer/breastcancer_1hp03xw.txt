I was diagnosed with stage 1 triple positive breast cancer at 39-did 12 weeks taxol, lumpectomy, radiation, a year of Herceptin and a year of Neratnib. I also started tamoxifen in March of 2022. 

I was doing fine on tamoxifen until Dec 23 when I had an ovarian torsion. I had tubes and one ovary removed. I had a dermoid cyst so they did not take me off tamoxifen. I was transferred to regular gp and don’t have an oncologist. Unfortunately just a week ago my left ovary ended up in torsion and I had the torsion fixed and the cyst removed on my left ovary. They also did a D&C and the ultrasound said my endometrium is irregular, diffuse heterogeneity and measuring 21mm. I haven’t had a period since Aug 2022 but am 42 and thought it was prob just the tamoxifen. 

I have two questions:

1) I decided to quit tamoxifen for the time being. I’ve been off for a week now and it’s been fine, but I’m extra tired…but also recovering from surgery. What should I expect in the next while? Any thing you noticed when taking a break or coming off? 

2) The ultrasound results have me concerned I might have endometrial hyperplasia or cancer. Anyone go through this with tamoxifen? I know it would be extremely concerning results if I was post menopausal but I honestly don’t know if I am with just one ovary, after chemo and in. my early 40’s. 

Any personal insights would be great. Thank you!
