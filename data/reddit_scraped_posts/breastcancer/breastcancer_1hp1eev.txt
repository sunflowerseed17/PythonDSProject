Hey all, got some insanely good news over Christmas about my cancer after a long, rough road. My cancer has no node involvement and all margins are clear. My tissue was sent for oncotyping and the nurse called to let me know my score is 7!! They will not be recommending chemotherapy for me and this is a huge win, I’m ecstatic! Initially I was terrified of the thought of not throwing everything at this cancer but I understand now it may do more harm than good. 

She also commented that when I meet with my oncologist they will recommend tamoxifen but may say there’s very little benefit for me with all the potential side effects. I am 36 and tamoxifen has been my greatest form of stress and fear through this entire journey. For context, I have suffered since 15 with gynecological issues and almost died in 2017 from a hemorrhage. The thought of taking a medication that can cause endometrial and uterine cancer TERRIFIES me. 

I still have another fill in my tissue expanders and I have daily pain from them. I cannot sleep properly and my life is generally miserable because of them but I am grateful that chemo won’t add a layer to that. It also means my exchange surgery can happen sooner than it would have with chemo!! 

I’m just curious if anyone in their 30s/40s decided to forego tamoxifen and endocrine therapy with ER/PR+ or ER+ cancer? Did you have recurrence? What was the recommendation from your oncologist? My only concern is that my invasive tumours were downgraded to grade 1 but I had a large spot of DCIS that was grade 2 and ER+ only.
