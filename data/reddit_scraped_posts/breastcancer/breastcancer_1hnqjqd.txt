Long story short I'm dealing with some medical stuff that is quickly becoming very expensive and is also making me want to downsize my belongings. I don't know if I have energy for looking up going rates, taking photos, creating listing descriptions, etc.

Would selling them in random lots of lets say, 5 or 10, be feasible? And if so, what should I probably price them at?

If not and selling individually is the way to go then please let me know :)
