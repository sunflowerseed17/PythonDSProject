Hi. I finally spoke with my surgeon yesterday and have a decision to make. For reference I’m 49yo, genetic negative, IDC ++-, currently grade 1 but surgeon thinks grade 2 based on low PR score. Waiting on lymph node biopsy. My decision: currently a candidate for a lumpectomy with for sure nipple loss plus radiation. I’m unsure about chemo but hoping for the best. (I see oncology tomorrow). Or I can have a SMX with likely no radiation unless lymph node is positive with reconstruction. I was leaning towards lumpectomy secondary to shorter recovery time. However, I’m concerned about my long term dislike of my no nipple deformed breast. I’m not that old and while I’m not way into my looks I want to feel good about myself and already have self esteem issues. If I have the lumpectomy with nipple loss and radiation, plastics is not an option from what I can understand. I like the potential of no radiation with the SMX but the much longer recovery time with it and reconstruction is also a big deal. I’m currently scheduled for a lumpectomy 1/28 and want this thing gone but have time to change my mind to SMX if I want but need to decide soon so we can get plastics involved. I’m so conflicted! Help please!
