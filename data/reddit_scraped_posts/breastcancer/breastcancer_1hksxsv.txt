Hello. I’m just at the beginning of my journey and haven’t started any treatment yet so am in the waiting game. I was wondering though if anyone had weight loss surgery prior to diagnosis and if it affected your treatment plan and ability to tolerate the medicine? I am finally at a healthy weight after struggling for so long. I had surgery 1.5 years ago and was ready to enjoy the rest of my life. Life has a funny way of tripping you up and changing plans for you. Anyway, I’m 49f IDC ++- and if anyone has any experience in this and has advice I would be grateful. I’m also freaking out about the weight gain from the meds. I know that’s superficial but I worked so damn hard.
