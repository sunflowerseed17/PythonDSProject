I have HER2+, ER/PR- cancer, diagnosed at age 32, stage 2A, grade 3 IDC. Most posts I read are TNBC, triple positive, or hormone positive. Looking for my her2+ friends. I know everyone’s experience is unique but haven’t seen one person have the low level of cancer I had and still have to go through the extensive amounts of chemo. I did 12 rounds of taxol (lower dose on a clinical trial) with 4 rounds of HP. I chose to have a unilateral mastectomy, although my doctor was encouraging lumpectomy since you could no longer feel my tumor after the first 4 rounds of taxol. I ended up having residual disease, RCB of 1.44 so just over the threshold for category II risk, which resulted in me needing 4 rounds of AC before starting on kadcyla. I have not seen one her2+ patient on here who had to do AC, so just looking for anyone who may have had a similar outcome.
