I had first chemo this afternoon (Immunotherapy + TC)

I feel really really tired. Achy and flu like. (No fever)

I think the steroids worked in that I don't feel nauseated, but they didn't give me energy - I just felt tired and wired and foggy. And actually I felt a bit drink for while this afternoon.

Exercise didn't help, just ramped up the exhausted feeling.

Feeling a bit wary about day 4 and 5 (the nurse said I might feel worse after the steroids wear off) and about how this feeling might get worse across many cycles.

I think I was expecting today to be the honeymoon of chemo, as like a it will get worse after day 1/ when steroids wear off.

Documenting all the things to discuss with the doctor.
 eek.
