Hi  Salary Exempt, employee. Home office is in DC. I worked remotely in NY. 

During covid they put hiring freeze. I was only employee in Payroll at time. This made me fully responsible for all payroll across the globe.

I had to work many hours, never took vacation or time off, due to work load for 5 years. Even holidays. 

My brother became sick (Brain Cancer) During that time. I informed my job, I would be caring for him. He was going to die in about 1 year and I was going to need time off, when he was ready for hospice. 

They hired me help. I had to train new person, take care of brother, and manage entire Global payroll.

After brother died, new employee did not step up. No one could reach her. I had to work, while giving my brother hospice,answer questions, while I prepared his body for funeral, and even during the funeral. Cause he died on Dec 26th 2021. Last payroll of the year is most important and we also have to set up all changes for next year. I could not ghosts my job since I was the Global Payroll Manager. 

I was supposed to have 5 days grievance leave. They called me back to work, and so did not get it. 

3 month later, had to have ER surgery. Was out of work for 7 weeks, but they side messaged me the entire time. 

Had mental breakdown, due to massive traumas and work burnout. Now I am on LTD and Drs now think I may not return to any work.

Can I sue my job for abuse or something?
