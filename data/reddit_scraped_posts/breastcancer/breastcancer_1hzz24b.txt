This waiting is insufferable.  

I was diagnosed on 1/6/25.  I have my first appointment with the oncologist & surgeon on the 20th. 

What QUESTIONS did you Ask your Oncologist? 

EDIT: Including pathology report

A. Right breast, outer central, tomosynthesis-guided core biopsy (hourglass): INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA (up to 0.45 cm), arising in a background of DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU, high nuclear grade (solid, clinging, and cribriform patterns), with comedo necrosis and calcifications; see comment. Focus suspicious for lymphovascular invasion.  

Immunohistochemical studies show the following results for invasive carcinoma (block A1): - Estrogen receptor (ER): LOW POSITIVE (10%, weak to moderate) - Progesterone receptor (PR): NEGATIVE (0%) - HER2: POSITIVE (3+) (>90% cells)   

B. Right breast, retroareolar, tomosynthesis-guided core biopsy (top hat): DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU, high nuclear grade (solid, clinging, and cribriform patterns) , with comedo necrosis and calcifications; see comment.  Immunohistochemical studies show the following results for DCIS (block B1): - Estrogen receptor (ER): POSITIVE (50%, weak to moderate) - Progesterone receptor (PR): NEGATIVE (0%)
