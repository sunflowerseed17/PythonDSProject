Hello there. I was diagnosed with breast cancer last month (37F). 

I was hoping to hear recs on medical oncologists as well as plastic surgeons for reconstruction. My surgeon is Dr Erica Hill with Saint Francis, so I *think* the oncologist needs to be associated with Saint Francis.

Any recs are MUCH appreciated! Or any "avoid this doc" comments! 

THANK YOU!!!
