My (34F) first round of chemo (AC) is on the 9th, and I'm the type of person who needs to hear worst case scenarios to feel prepared- it allows me to set expectations at the lowest, and then be pleasently surprised if that's not the outcome.  

A little back story: I've had a bunch of chronic, but minor, illnesses for much of my life. 

The main combined symptoms of my illnesses have been: migraines that cause vision problems and nausea, hair loss, fatigue, constipation, GERD, dry skin, joint/bone pain, neuropathy, hormone-related mood issues, brain fog..the works! One of the medications meant to manage one of my illnesses even caused "you have 1 minute to get to a bathroom " type diarrhea.

I say all that to say that essentially, I feel like I've spent my life dealing with what I'm seeing are common side effects of chemo. That combined with doctors telling me that since I'm young it "won't be that bad" is giving me a false sense of confidence.

I know that everyone has different experiences, but would some of you lovely folks mind sharing your BAD chemo stories?
