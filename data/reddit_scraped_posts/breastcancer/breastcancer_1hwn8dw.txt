I finished my chemotherapy the week before Halloween and just started radiation on Monday. I started Herceptin at the end of July and they added Perjeta on in September. Thursday I had one of my regular echos to keep an eye on my heart and got a call from my NP yesterday saying that my pump function is down. They want to send me for a MUGA test to confirm their concerns and from there determine if we need to take a break from treatment. I am just curious if anyone else has had to deal with this? I’m 31f with three young kids and the thought of having issues with my heart is scary, but I’m also nervous about not being able to continue with my treatment as they already have concerns that the cancer might have spread and I have a genetic mutation. Any experiences from others would be greatly appreciated!
