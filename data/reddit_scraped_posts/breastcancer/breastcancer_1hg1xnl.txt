Hi. Today I was diagnosed with TNBC. I have one mass and one lymph node. My PET Scan is Thursday. I am so scared. I’m scared of everything right now. The chemo, surgery, radiation, reoccurrence, what is it spread. I’ve seen the stats on Google. I know I shouldn’t. I feel like I am spiraling. Can anyone give me any hope?
