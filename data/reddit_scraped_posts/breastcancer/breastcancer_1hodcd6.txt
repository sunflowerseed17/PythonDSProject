Tool suggestions

I have several wigs now. 

Two are heat friendly with curls.  How often do I use heat on them. How do I keep the curls the same? 

Three are synthetic NOT HEAT Friendly.  I usually style these with steam but sometimes I see people use a hot air brush????? Is this true? 

Is there a hot air brush or heat comb I can use on both? 
Thank you
