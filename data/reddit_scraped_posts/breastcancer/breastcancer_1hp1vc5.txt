I have read others post mentioning this and it sounds pretty awesome, at least in theory. My question is- do people actually have a single point of contact that helps them figure this shit out? When I went to my post- surgery follow up I asked if there was a navigator that would help me with next steps. The PA answered from her perspective- she said we all work very closely together. But on my end I don’t always see that. I had asked the surgeon about the oncotype. Oh, the oncologist should be ordering that for you. I didn’t have that appt for a few more weeks so I called to get confirmation that it had been ordered. It did happen, but 2 weeks post surgery which means I had the first appt last week without it. So more waiting. Sigh. I know this phase is hard, but I am really curious if other health systems do in fact have this figured out any better?!
