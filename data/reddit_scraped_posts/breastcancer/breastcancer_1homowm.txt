Hello! I will make this short and sweet. 

I am 23 years old, I just finished chemotherapy October 31st and had a DMX December 5th. 

I want to get back to feeling like myself. One thing that is getting in the way of that is extreme vaginal dryness. I can’t even put a moisturizer tube in without pain and it feels as if there’s a blockage. TMI but even a q-tip won’t go in and it’s just bone dry

I saw an OBGYN and she told me that it looked red and irritated and dry, to use vaginal moisturizers. 

I guess the whole point of this is to ask: does this every go away? I understand that if I’m in early menopause it won’t ever go away, but I want to know peoples experiences. 

How long will this last?????? How long before a period returns if there is one??? How do I live with this if it’s permanent!!!!? 

I’m lucky I have a patient and loving partner, but I want to be active with them, I miss them. 

THANK YOU
