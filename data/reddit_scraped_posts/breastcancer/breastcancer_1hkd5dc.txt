I got all my chemo infusion via IV in my right hand. I never faced much problems with the IV placement throughout the course of chemo (maybe a little swelling here and there). When I went for my PET scan 2 weeks after my last infusion, my veins just gave up. I think I was poked 5 times in the right arm at different places. Each placement was extremely painful  and when they tried to flush the vein each time, it was excruciating. I was crying the whole time. Eventually my MO informed the nurses to use the other arm. 

I don't have a port and I don't want one, especially not after I am finished with chemo. I know people are gonna come at me saying "this wouldn't have happened if you have gotten a port", but I really don't want it. Has this happened to anyone else? I have an upcoming surgery and I am worried about the same thing happening again. Is there any way I could somehow heal my veins? Or do something to make this process easier?
