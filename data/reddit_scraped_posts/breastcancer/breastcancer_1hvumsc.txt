Had my follow up with SO & MO yesterday. My SO ordered an ultrasound for the new lump on the left just to make sure it’s just firm tissue and not necrotic (BMX with DIEP flap in November). So thankful he listened to me and took me seriously. Had a blood draw last week but of course it wasn’t back before my MO appointment. Frustrating but, it happens. The report came in last night so of course I looked at them (does anyone not??) My estrogen levels have increased from 81 in August to 243. I’m post-menopausal (radical hysterectomy) and I didnt even know it was possible for my body to still produce that much estrogen since I don’t have ovaries! The levels are close to that of a woman in her first trimester! Because I am HR+ I am completely freaking out over what this means and why it’s so high. Even though I know my doctor got the results I sent them into the portal anyway to be like “WTF.” It’s so frustrating that it seems around every corner is a brand new surprise. Started exemestane last night after anastrozole kicked my ass so hard so hopefully it’ll be doing its job here shortly. 🤞🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻
