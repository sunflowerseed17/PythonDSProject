I am almost three years post DMX, with reconstruction over the last 18 months (implants, fat grafting, nipple reconstruction). Recently have noticed this lump in between my breasts, on my sternum or xiphoid process (new word I learned via google!). It's a decent-sized lump, larger than a quarter, and feels like cartilage or one of those fatty lumps you find on older dogs (eek, I guess that's me now). It's uncomfortable and gets swollen when I wear a bra, but it is still there when I go without. 

I'm hoping maybe it is some fat that migrated to the area, and someone else has experienced the same thing? Fortunately, I have a dr. appt on Tues, so don't have long to wait, but I'm concerned, and wondering if I should have it scanned or biopsied, even if the doctor says, "don't worry, it's a fatty deposit."  

Let me know if you've experienced anything similar. Thanks Also, it looks like we can't post photos in this sub, right?
