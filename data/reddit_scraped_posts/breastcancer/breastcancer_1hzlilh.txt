I woke up today feeling like impending doom. I can't feel anything, just going through motions. My first app with surgeon and medical oncologist tomorrow. We haven't told many people, planning to after tomorrow and just dressing it all. I am normally a go getter, sunshine and rainbows, happy to be going through life and today, and the past few weeks I can hardly get out of bed.  Someone tell me I'll be okay, and this gets better... I need to find my ourself again.
