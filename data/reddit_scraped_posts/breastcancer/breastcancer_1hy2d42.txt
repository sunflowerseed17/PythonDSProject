Looking for advice on making this touch decision. 45 f with new diagnosis of IDC ++-, with no family hx, non smoker. Caught early on screening mammo and suspected no node involvement. Surgeons are recommending lumpectomy but I am really struggling with this decision. I have always told myself if ever faced with this decision I would choose DMX and I still feel I would be wrong not to choose the DMX to further protect myself from reoccurrence. Docs say the chance of reoccurrence is very low because I have no family hx but I feel for this very same reason I have a very low chance to be faced with breast cancer right now, yet here I am! Wanted to reach out to the experts, you ladies, for first hand recommendations. Thank you üôè
