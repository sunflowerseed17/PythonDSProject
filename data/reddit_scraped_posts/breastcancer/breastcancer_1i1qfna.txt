So this week I am meeting with my radiation oncologist and the next day my medical oncologist. I had a lumpectomy on 12/13 and last week got my post op results. Even without an oncotype score (I was surprised that didn't come with the post op results) my surgeon has a hunch that chemo will be needed.

Can anyone recommend some good questions to ask at each meeting? I only have a few, mostly relating to my already being immunocompromised due to medication I take for an autoimmune disorder I've had a long time and how radiation/chemo might affect that, but I'm not sure what else I should ask about?
