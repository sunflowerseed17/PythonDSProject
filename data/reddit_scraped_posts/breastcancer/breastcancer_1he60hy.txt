Hi everyone!  I am 48 and was diagnosed with bilateral Stage 1a Grade 3 ++- in March.  Completed lumpectomies and radiation, and started endocrine therapy in September.  I chose to do ovarian suppression via monthly Zoladex shot and tamoxifen (20mg).  I’ve gained just over 10 pounds since starting the endocrine therapy, and haven’t had any substantial changes to my lifestyle.  I’m very active, train daily, and eat well.  I’m guessing this is a normal response to the witches brew of both going into immediate menopause and the Tamoxifen.  It doesn’t feel good in my body - I feel sluggish and heavy. I don’t know what to do!  Anyone else experience this???
