Has anyone used blackstrap molasses for dressings with either tahini or miso?  I'm curious about blackstrap, tahini, and lemon juice. I am also curious about blackstrap and miso dressing combos, and I'm not sure which miso may pair best with blackstrap.  Any thoughts?  Simple recipes with fewer ingredients tend to work better for me. 

I know blackstrap has doubters, but I really do like its flavor.
I have been mixing a tablespoon with two tablespoons hazelnut butter, a dash of vanilla, a dash of salt and a teaspoon of baking cocoa (all guesstimate amounts) for snacks daily!
