I am almost done with my 4 courses of chemo. Radiation tx to follow. Anything I need to prepare for or expect? I don’t get to see the rad onco until mid January. Do they do a mold fold the chest to keep you secure? What kind of clothing and bra  to wear that would be convenient and comfortable for the treatment. I had a lumpectomy done. I am also worried because it’s my left breast and it’s close to the heart.
