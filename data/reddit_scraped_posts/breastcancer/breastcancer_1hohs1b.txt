I'm new to Shotsy since they just released an app for Android, so maybe this tip is commonplace but I found it interesting. 
There's a place on the home screen that shows the level of Tirz in our system. Before my shot, it was 2.45 and 7 hours later, it's 5.4. I just upped to 5mg this morning but thought it was interesting that it took 7 hours to reach the full dose.
