Iâ€™m curious to know if people like me, who had a lot of medical radiation exposure, are disproportionately represented here in the breast cancer community.

Did you have much medical radiation exposure in your life before getting breast cancer?  

Did you have many mammograms before being diagnosed with breast cancer, or was your breast cancer diagnosed at one of your first mammograms?
