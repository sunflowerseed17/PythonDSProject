im going to be 4 weeks post masectomy on tuesday…
while the physiotherapeut told me i shouldnt invest in expensive ‚scar‘ cremes i can just buy bepanthen or something:. she didnt tell me when to even start with a creme? and i didnt think about to ask🤦🏼‍♀️
i still have very little scabs on some places over the scar… should i wait until they fall off?
