Title: Has anyone insisted on Tamoxifen over the more aggressive AI/ovarian suppression?

I’m 40 years old with IDC ++- Grade 2 Oncotype 12 Ki67 24%.  No lymph node involvement. Double mastectomy in which we found the tumor was 5cm.

When I was still waiting for a surgery date my oncologist thought my treatment plan would be possibly chemo or radiation followed by tamoxifen. She explained then that ovarian suppression injections and AIs were a tiny bit more effective than tamoxifen but much harsher. Now, after the oncotype score, clear nodes, and yeah large tumor she is switching her recommendation to the shot + harsher pills and I’m a little upset.  The difference still seems small to me — 12% risk of recurrence in 10 years with the harsher drugs and 15% with tamoxifen.

The other issue is that the shot Zoladex also carries a risk of jaw bone loss and I think I’m already at elevated risk for that (lost four adult teeth prematurely due to an eating disorder from 14-30).

Am i being silly Here?
