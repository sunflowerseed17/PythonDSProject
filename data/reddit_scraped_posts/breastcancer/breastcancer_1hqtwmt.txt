Hi everyone, I had two lumpectomies within 2 weeks from each other . The second one was for better margins. My Dr didn’t put a draine on my breast. I’ve been dealing with fluid build up in the past 3 weeks.  Last week the Dr removed 175ml of fluid from my breast. 
I will be seeing the Dr this Thursday again and I already can tell I have quite a bit of fluid again.
I’m 43F PR+, ER+ Her- Stage 1a low Oncotype and I was supposed to have radiation by now. 
I’m a bit concerned with a delay of the whole process. I can’t have my mapping or start rads until this fluid build up situation is resolved. 
If anyone has dealt with this and has any suggestions I appreciate it. 
I have already started on tamoxifen.
