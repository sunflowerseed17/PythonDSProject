Has anyone ever experienced sharp shooting pains in the nipple of the affected breast during pacli/carbo chemotherapy?

I had a lumpectomy on July 7th. So I don't know if that's causing any pain. I've been having this pain since yesterday and it's a sharp pain that comes, lingers for a few seconds and goes, every once in a while. I've never really noticed it being this intense before. It's been almost 3 weeks since my previous infusion and I'll be going in for my next one in 2 days.
