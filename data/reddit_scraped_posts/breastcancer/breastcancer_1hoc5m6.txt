I’m am 2 weeks post DMX to flat closure. I am having next to no pain now except for the burning nerve pain across my entire chest. 

Unfortunately I can’t take Gabapentin or Lyrica due to allergies, so I’m looking for natural solutions to deal with this feeling. 

What have you tried (successfully) that wasn’t a pill? And how long does this feeling last? 

Thanks!
