SO...about two months ago I found a lump in my breast. Fast forward to today, I finally had it confirmed that it's cancer. I'm dealing with it pretty well so far- I feel like I was sent dozens of signs over those 2 months (the release of TGI included) that made me feel in my bones that it was cancer- almost like I was being mentally prepared for the diagnosis.

Anyway, when H first announced the album I was excited at the prospect of a tour- I've seen them live 3 times, but each has been a 'special' show, never for  a tour. I had Manic tixs,  but as we all know COVID ruined that. I also had tixs to IICHLIWP, but it was for the Maryland show (iykyk ðŸ¥²). I joked then that if something happens to stop me a third time, I was going to lose it. Y'all- I stg if I miss the tour about battling cancer, because I am battling cancer, I will punch air ðŸ˜­
