I am so mad/ sad. Dealt with first cancer (2B invasive)during Covid - lumpectomy the day every thing shut down 3/16/2020 because reconstruction surgeon got Covid and couldnâ€™t be there to do the reconstruction.  Then they found cancer in my lymph nodes and removed 6.  I went through chemotherapy and radiation.  Tamoxifen for almost 5 years. I cold capped so only lost 50% of my hair.  Itâ€™s all grown back thick with a wave now. This last  November I feel lump in same breast.  Turns out to be 2 tumors, not very hormone responsive. I am scheduled for mastectomy with reconstruction January 16th and breast reduction on other side.  Will have other side mastectomy 6 mos later once it heals.  Just depressed and tired of people saying that â€žâ€œI have thisâ€œ.  I donâ€™t have a choice to not have this. Thanks for making it through my rant. ðŸ˜”
