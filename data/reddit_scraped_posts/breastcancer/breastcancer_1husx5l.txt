Hi, secondary lymphoedema in my right arm after axillary node clearance here ... I know you're supposed to exercise, but that there are certain exercises you're not supposed to do. It's all very confusing because what you're not supposed to do looks very similar to what you are. I was discharged from the lymphoedema clinic the day they diagnosed me, with a compression sleeve and an email packet about self-massage, so I have no idea who to ask. Google seems to give me conflicting information, but maybe I'm just misunderstanding it. 

I want to start exercising because I've been very sedentary during cancer treatment. A personal trainer said she wouldn't work with me unless I had a medical professional sign off on what I could and couldn't do. But I'm not sure if I'm in touch with any medical professional who would know about lymphoedema specifically. I don't expect my GP to have any expertise in it, but maybe they can look it up and that will count. My oncologist might know?

I went to the gym a couple of times just to do cardio (brisk walking on the treadmill), because I didn't know that could cause swelling too, but it has, and it's been two days since, and it hasn't gone down. Obviously I need to exercise, but you're supposed to stop if it causes swelling. Are you supposed to keep stopping? Does this mean I have to start swimming instead, or will my body get used to the increased level of activity? And do I have to wait for the swelling to go down to exercise again? 

Edit: I am using my compression sleeve while I exercise, and all day.
