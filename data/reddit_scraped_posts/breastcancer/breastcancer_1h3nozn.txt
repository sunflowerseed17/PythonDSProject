I’m about to finish 6 weeks of radiation and it was really aggressive and painful, it’s getting better but now I’m noticing I have chicken pox like bumps on my torso and face. I might be allergic to one of the creams I’ve been using (I’m allergic to lots) but they aren’t very itchy. Did anyone else experience this from radiation?
