I had post chemo scans yesterday. They cleared some suspicious kidney and liver spots, and told me my ultrasound and mammogram looked "beautiful". There was some residual tumor, but they think it's purely scar tissue, so they expect (but didn't promise) pCR. 

I was terrified of this appointment, so I feel like I should at least be relieved a little. Instead, I feel depressed, anhedonic, and blank about it. Sure, there's uncertainty remaining until surgery itself, but I don't feel any relief at all, even about the fear of metastasis at least being temporarily (logically) quelled.

Maybe my brain hasn't caught up yet, but I am just baffled at how good news has made me feel worse than before. Granted, other hard things are going on right now that would dilute happiness, but it all feels like a net negative and I don't understand.
