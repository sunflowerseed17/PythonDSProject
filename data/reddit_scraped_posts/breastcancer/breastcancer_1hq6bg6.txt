It's surgery day. Finally. SMX with axillary node removal. I have prepared myself mentally for everything, pre-surgery and post-surgery. I have been through a lot of hard stuff in my life. Pregnancies, child-births, 2 minor surgeries and chemo. But this is a whole new arena. I have been trying to stay calm, and so far I am. I have accepted that I will be losing a breast. I have accepted that I need time to heal and I have support for that. Everything is in place and ready to go. But I am so scared of what am I going to wake up to. I am afraid that what if it's worse than what I am expecting? I have a plan in mind about how I am going to deal with this but I am scared of being caught completely off-guard.  What if it's the worst case scenario? What if I end up in constant, unbearable pain? I don't want to panic last minute. Please please share with me some hopeful and positive stories about how it wasn't too bad for you all. I really need it right now. Something to give me last minute grace to go get this done!
