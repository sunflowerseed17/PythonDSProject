I am getting a loading dose of Perjeta tomorrow and they want to do this early in the day and monitor, followed by Herceptin and then TC chemo infusions in the early afternoon.  Do I need to cold cap during Perjeta?  The timing really doesn't work for pre or post cooling periods.  I've read mixed answers on this.
