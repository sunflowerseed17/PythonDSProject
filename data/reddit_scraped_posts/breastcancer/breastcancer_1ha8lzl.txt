My surgery is in 1 week, and I am spending this week getting the house ready for recovery. 

What did you do to prepare?

My list:

✅ making some freezer meals for my husband to reheat.

✅ Installing a bidet

✅ setting up my bedroom with both the wedge pillow and a comfy recliner

✅ creating a separation zone for our 3 dogs so they can’t jump on me

✅ cleaning the house so that I’m not sitting there staring at something that needs to be done

✅ wrapping everything for the holiday and pretending surgery day is Christmas Day so it’s all done

✅ grocery shopping to fill the fridge and Costco stocking the house with snacks for my kids who are coming back from college the day after surgery

What am I forgetting??
