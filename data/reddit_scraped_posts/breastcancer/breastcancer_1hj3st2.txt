I stopped my estradiol patch a month ago after finishing breast cancer surgery and radiation. I’ve since developed severe overactive bladder at night— I’m up peeing and having hot flashes every hour for the entire night. I’m absolutely exhausted.

I’ve had two urine cultures and they were negative. I did have bacterial vaginitis and I treated that, but I’m already having vaginal burning from atrophy. 

I can’t tolerate vaginal estrogen.

I tried taking oxybutynin for overactive bladder but it’s making me crazy, giving me dry mouth, and making me super fatigued. 

Has anyone else had this type of bladder problem after discontinuing estrogen? What did you take for it to help? 

I’m desperate. Thank you!
