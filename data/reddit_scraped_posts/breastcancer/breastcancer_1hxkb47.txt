Iâ€™m a 43F and had DMX (initial diagnosis DCIS with 7cm tumour) on Dec 17 (I was freaking out big time on day of my surgery and had posted here) I met my surgeon today who shared the pathology results with me. Cancer was primarily in my left breast with abnormal cell growth on right. My left nymph nodes have come back clear but the right lymph nodes are positive for isolated tumour cells. So Iâ€™ve been referred to the cancer agency for further investigation. Only thing it says on my report is Grade 3, ER positive with Allred score 7/8. 
The surgeon says itâ€™s odd that right lymph nodes tested positive and theyâ€™re being cautious so they donâ€™t under treat me. Anyone knows what could be going on here or what to expect while I wait to hear from the cancer agency.
Iâ€™m in Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ for reference.
