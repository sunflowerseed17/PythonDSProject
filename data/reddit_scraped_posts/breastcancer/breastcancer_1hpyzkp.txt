Before I stated neoadjuvant chemo in June I was still having healthy periods, but they stopped after my 2nd infusion and havenâ€™t come back. I had SMX on 12/13 and will start radiation mid January. Had my follow-up with my oncologist today and was prescribed letrazole without any mention or plan for ovarian suppression. Just curious if anyone else has been in this situation? Should I just take the letrazole and plan on informing my oncologist if my period does come back?
