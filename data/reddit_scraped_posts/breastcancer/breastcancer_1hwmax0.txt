I, 48f ++-, stage 2b will be starting chemo in a few weeks (pending PET). I am the type of person that needs to be prepared. I plan on purchasing items that will help me get through. Specifically, soft and warm head wraps, cheap wigs, what type of meds should I stock up on (Claritin, immodium). What did you find that you needed and used often? Any and all advice will be appreciated. I don't know what type of chemo I'm getting yet so it may be hard to provide definitive suggestions but just in general. I am putting things in my Amazon cart but realized that I really need help to ensure I get what I need. Tia.
