I had two surgeries. Last one was 3weeks ago. One before was 2.5 weeks prior. They had to go back for margins and flush a hematoma. I still have Steri-Strips on the lumpectomy site, three weeks later. I am waiting for them to fall off naturally since the last time the doctor ripped them off it opened the incision. Anyways, I have a rash all across my chest. It has been pretty itchy for a few weeks now. Has anybody else experience this?
