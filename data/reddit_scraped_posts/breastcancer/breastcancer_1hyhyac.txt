I wanted to share a celebration post! I don't know how it's possible but I got my pathology report back already!! My surgery was just yesterday! I had a lumpectomy & the margins were clear and lymph nodes were negative! I'm so excited and wanted to post here too! The tumor was a bit larger than caputured in the MRI- as it is 2.8 cm. And my right boob (formerly cancer boob) is a smaller than the left now, but that's okay!!! I'll embrace the unevenness and take this as a win!!

My SO ordered the oncotype before my surgery and it was a 19, so with the negative lymph nodes, I don't think chemo is indicated! Hopefully straight to radiation for me. 

Thanks for the read!!

Edit- wow thank you for all of the comments and up votes! I told my friend and family about these results, and while they were very happy and excited, they just don't get it the same way yall do! Thank you so much for the love and support!! 

Also, something I thought was cool was I had an all women OR! And then looking at my pathology report, it was done by a woman too! Idk I just love that & think it's neat! ❤️❤️❤️
