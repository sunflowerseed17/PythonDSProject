2023 was the worse year. That’s the year in June diagnosed with cancer. Chemo was done by November 2023 and was found to be cancer free in Jan 2024. 
But 2024 was the lumpectomy in Jan, followed by radiation until March. 2024 
Then frozen shoulder and painful rehab from April until October 2024 
Seroma developed in Oct 
Infection in Seroma in Oct followed by emergency surgery to clean out the infection. 
Now it’s Dec 30 and I’m still having the wound packed every other day. Very painful and the tissue doesn’t seem to want to heal. 

The irony is the cancer was gone in 2023 but here I am going into 2025 still dealing with the fall out of the treatment. 
Cancer sucks. Treatment for cancer sucks worse but it’s all better than not being treated and dying from the damn thing. 
Here’s to 2025. I’m alive.
