Is it safe to take callogen supplements and biotin?  I used to take them religiously before my bc diagnosis helped alot..now that I am post chemo and only to do in 2 wks rads..i am on Herceptin every 3 weeks..Tamoxifen daily. Is it safe to take them again? I feel i need something to help hair growth and immunity...especially stamina and feeling just good inside. What do you all take?
