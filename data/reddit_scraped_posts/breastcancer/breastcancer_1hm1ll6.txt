Happy Hanukkah, joyous solstice, delightful Kwanza, or felicitous holiday whatever it may be!

To all my fellow cancer patients and cancer survivors with one boob, two boobs, no boobs, real boobs, fake boobs or one of each, may all the blessings and trimmings of the season make you forget for one day about cancer. (Unless those trimmings are hair, because you had to chop it off during well, you know….then you have my utmost sympathy!)

May you receive the gifts of love and hope and strength and time this year. May the new year be better than this past one and bring you all peace, prosperity, and good health. May your side effects be minimal and treatment go smoothly. 

Congrats on making it this far. By this time next year I hope all of you who are struggling will have put this in the rearview mirror. You got this!
