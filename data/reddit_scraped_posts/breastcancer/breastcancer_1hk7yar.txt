This past year was the hardest year of my life. I beat breast cancer and am in my maintenance phase for the next 5 years, which is still physically impactful (but better than chemo). I’m beyond grateful for all the difficult treatments and surgeries and am just happy to be here. 

With the holidays here, I can’t help but think about how unfair it is that I get to live while so many don’t. Everyone I know who had a loved one battling cancer this year lost that loved one except one (4 losses, 1 still battling and doing well). I keep thinking about them during the holidays and am just so sad for them. I’ve kept my diagnosis off of social media because I feel like it would be distasteful to be all celebratory over my success with treatment when others are grieving such significant losses. I’m an open book and don’t mind sharing about my journey at all, but many think I’m just so private about it because I can’t bring myself to post something that could cause grief to others. 

I know this is probably more in my head, and I’ve even had some of those people reach out and check on me throughout my treatment knowing mine was going better than their loved one’s was. I know those who’ve passed would absolutely want me to celebrate this win, but it just feels wrong. 

Part of the purpose of my post was to just put my feelings somewhere, and the other part I guess is just to see if any others feel this way too? I am genuinely happy to be here, but I feel so sad for those missing their loved ones and for those whose treatments haven’t gone as well as they’d hoped. Cancer sucks. Blessings to you all. ❤️
