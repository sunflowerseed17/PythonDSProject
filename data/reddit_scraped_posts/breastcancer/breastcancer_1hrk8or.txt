I finished radiation in May of 2024. I was given some antibiotics for a sinus infection two days ago. They started me on Augmentin but I did not tolerate it wellâ€¦.it gave me a lot of nausea and I was vomiting. I had never had that issue with that medicine before. I was switched to Cefdinir, which I have also tolerated well but am now having bad headaches, not sinus related, and some nausea. Does radiation completely change your tolerance level for some meds?
