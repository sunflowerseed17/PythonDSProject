I’m just wondering what is going on here. I am 53 and have been living this blessed life. All of a sudden before Christmas I find out the painful lump in my breast is aggressive cancer. Then my heat pump dies during the coldest snap of the year, and today I feel a pop in my lower back when lifting chicken feed. So now I’m laying on a bag of ice wondering what kharma has in store for me next. Just had to vent a little - I guess this is just my season of character (aka surviving the pain).
