I’m 41 little cluster of cancer in my right breast, and one lymph (r). Just had a call from my Oncoplastic surgeon who has been advised by the medical onc that surgery is recommended first, I think she said the cancer is not responsive to chemo. 

The cancer is responsive to oestrogen and progesterone. 

She will take the whole breast (& lymph and whatever is needed) I actually asked her to take both ( and my ovaries too..?) and she recommended not as further healing or complications from extra surgery could delay radiation. 

Should I be panicking? It scares me that chemo is not an option. Though I think she said it’s not ruled out. I see her Monday to get clarity again and have someone with me

Would this make me + + -
