Or Lupron, etc. 

Got my first injection yesterday, have a follow up in a month for labs and to see if I’m in menopause before starting AIs, and I assume a second shot.

Has anyone had an easy experience? I’ve read so many horror stories. I desperately need some fairy tales. 

Also, a question if anyone is so inclined- I am 47 and was staunchly in perimenopause. My periods were 5-6 months apart and barely noticeable, and for about 2 years I have been experiencing peri symptoms already, including frequent hot flashes, night sweats, joint pain, insomnia and increased anxiety. 

Given my already abysmal estrogen levels, shouldn’t these shots and the concurrent AIs be not-as-bad as they would for someone who still had ample estrogen?
