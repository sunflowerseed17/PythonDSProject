My aunt and uncle are in their early 70s. They are married adults with intellectual disabilities and my uncle is also legally blind. Over Christmas, my aunt fell down the stairs at my parents' house (she's fine, but banged up) and it made us all realize that we need them closer to us.

However, they have some unique challenges when it comes to housing. Right now, they live in a single floor condo with two bedrooms and one bathroom and it has suited their needs. They have lived independently (together) for nearly forty years. They know all of their neighbors and can navigate their town well with buses.

We would like to find something similar in the Iowa City/Coralville area. They are reluctant to be in a retirement community, but the family feels like it's time for them to have some support. We would like to find something that is single story, preferably with an external entrance, near bus routes (they don't drive and while we plan on being involved, they won't want to rely on us entirely), and has some community. They would not be able to care for a yard or clear snow. They don't have many medical needs and don't keep pets. Also, it has to be relatively inexpensive because they are retired and live mostly on social security.

My uncle is very proud and doesn't like to ask for help or rely on others. It's a big step that they are considering moving closer to the family.

Any advice, Reddit? Maybe some retirement community with more of a condo feel? Remember, stairs are the enemy.
