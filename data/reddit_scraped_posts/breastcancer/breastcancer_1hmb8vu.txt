Hello,

My 74 year old mom who lives alone is undergoing 5 months of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. 4 rounds of AC every two weeks and then 12 rounds of Taxol every 12 weeks. I am staying with her for the first round but I live far away and won't be able to be here for much of it. Other friends should be supporting when I'm not here. The cancer is ER positive HER2 negative and the oncologist said it's 'between stages 2-3'.

Although my mom's in OK health otherwise, she has a low tolerance for pain/discomfort and a bad history of not following doctor's orders for other conditions, e.g. skipping her meds because she doesn't like how they make her feel or she just forgets. She's also really struggled to follow any of the medical information she's been receiving, even the fundamental things like how many rounds of chemo. I am take copious notes at every appointment.

I'm worried about how much she's going to struggle with the chemo side effects, how she will cope or even if she'll try to stop the treatment altogether. (I'm also worried about making sure she remembers to take all her side effect meds.)

I've put together a list of all the side effect medications the doctor recommended in an easy to read document for my mom, visible here: [https://imgur.com/a/VdpQUYl](https://imgur.com/a/VdpQUYl) 

**Do you have any other tips to help with AC and Taxol?** Some of the things I'm wondering are:

\- Should my mom take her 'as needed' anti-nausea drugs as a preventative before she feels nauseaus? For how long?  
\- If she really can't bear the chemo, do they ever decide to cut the chemo short and operate as an alternative?   
\- Any other OTC or natural medications I should get for her?  
\- Anything you want to share specifically about what AC and Taxol is like and how you got through it?

Thanks for all your help
