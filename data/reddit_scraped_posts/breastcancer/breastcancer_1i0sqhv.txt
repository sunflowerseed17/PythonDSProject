Dx with DCIS last February. Single mastectomy on the left in April. Had expander placed in May and implant (left) and lift (right) in December. My boobs look lopsided and just generally not ok. I am not symmetrical at all. My surgeon wants to do revisions in June to include fixing the symmetry and putting an implant on the right. Anyone happy with surgery after a single mastectomy? Anyone have experiences with revision surgery? I am not a candidate for DIEP. Imolant is my only option.
