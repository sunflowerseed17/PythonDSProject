Hi all, quick question for those who have had lumpectomies. I do remember reading something about occasional nerve pain afterwards. I am two weeks post-surgery and am having pain. Last two days. Not terrible, but uncomfortable. Feels like intermittent poky jabs in the nipple area and near where the lump was. All part of healing? I  am just surprised it took two weeks.🙏🏻
