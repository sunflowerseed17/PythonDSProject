My mo wants me to start taking Kisqali. I'm also going to be starting letrozole. Along with that, she wants me start getting Zometa infusions for osteoprosis. 

I'm unsure about taking Kisqali in my particular case, and I'd rather not take Zometa. I'd rather take a bisphosphonate like Fosamax in tablet form instead of the Zometa infusion.

First, about Kisqali.  I read a couple studies indicating that patients with advanced breast cancer who took  CDK 4/6 inhibitors like Kisqali had worse response rates than those who were HER2 negative. The difference was quite significant.

Do any of you have any insight into this? All I've heard about Kisqali is it's such a great drug.

However, in trying to learn more about it, it sounds like there's a general disagreement about Kisqali being okay for HER2 low patients. (There's also disagreement about HER2 low actually being a thing or not. It's complicated. None of this is easy,)

Secondly, I'm going to start letrozole and need to start taking something for osteoporosis. As I already said, I want to take a bisphosphonate in a tablet form rather than as an infusion.

Does anyone else take the tablets? There's been a couple studies comparing Zometa with other bisphosphonates  in tablet form, and the tablets were none inferior.

Any  ideas or feedback is appreciated. I have an appt. tomorrow at my mo's office. I'm not even sure if I'm going to see the doctor in order to get some clarification about all of this. My doctor told me at my last appointment I was going to start these three drugs - kind of end of story. She doesn't explain anything, and at that point I had no questions. I'm feeling really frustrated at this point.
