I’ll add my voice to others who have shown appreciation for this group. I have been just reading, not posting, largely because my questions are often asked and answered by other posters. I was diagnosed with IDC and had a lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy Oct. 30. The tumor was 2.2 cm, + - -, clear margins and lymph node, but radiation was recommended because one of the margins was smaller than ideal (tumor too close to the muscle). I have finished partial breast radiation and now have to decide about hormone blockers.

I’m post-menopausal so no my situation may be different from many of yours. Anyone with thoughts about hormone blockers? The doctors say just do it, but I’m so afraid of them making me feel sick, tired, achy, and old. I’ve always felt healthy and strong so this whole cancer thing is a blow.
