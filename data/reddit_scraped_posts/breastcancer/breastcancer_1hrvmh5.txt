I know best actor has been discussed here before, but I was wondering if anyone’s opinion had ever been changed by a specific episode. 

I’ve always thought Glenn was easily the most skilled. I still do, and always will. 

My husband has always thought Charlie was best, and tends to site his ability to shift from his baseline hysteria to idiot savant to thoughtful intelligence so handily. He thinks Charlie’s “little miss *all that*” song-or-no-song monologue is brilliant, which it is.

Anyway, I’m a bigger Sunny fanatic and tend to watch episodes as soon as they’re available. However, last night my husband watched Dennis Takes a Mental Health Day for the first time and now thinks Glenn is the best actor, primarily because of the heavy lifting he does alone on the side of the road. Most of the gang thrive while interacting with each other, but it’s a different beast to act alone, with that much range, skill, and time THAT well. 

Anyone else have a single episode change their opinion of the best (not necessarily favorite) actor? Thought it was interesting.
