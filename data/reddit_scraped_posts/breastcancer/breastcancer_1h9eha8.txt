I was diagnosed with breast cancer, am seeing my surgeon tomorrow to decide on what next and to discuss my PET scan results (no spread, limited to 3 lymph nodes) and further testing.

But found out that my work insurance no longer has cashless admittance/guarantee and wants me to pay first, then claim. They made this change December 1.

Of course, no one trusts insurers so I don't know if they would even pay up because, well, insurers. 

The good news it that public healthcare in my country is good and affordable but understaffed as well as underfunded (what else is new).

I know my cancer is still early stages and I can scrounge up money to pay for the surgery to remove my 3cm lump and then switch to my public healthcare.

And after paying, I can withdraw money from my national retirement fund to reimburse the cost (if insurance refuses to pay up\_ and I have family willing to help out some.

Still, I'm devastated and upset because I was counting on being able to just get the surgery without having to dig out coins from the sofa.

Buy insurance/get a job with good insurance, they said.

I'm sad and tired but tomorrow is another day.
