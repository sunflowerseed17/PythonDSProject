Hi! I am wondering if any of you has experienced swelling on the face, arms (specially chemo arm for those without a port) fingers and torax. It seems to be worse after lying down. I wake up swollen and it mildly improves during the day. 

Has this happened to you? If so, did it go away? Did your doctors said anything about this? Like what is causing it. Does capillary leak syndrome was ever mentioned to you by your medical team? I am freaking out about this. I hope someone can share their experience. Thank you in advance
