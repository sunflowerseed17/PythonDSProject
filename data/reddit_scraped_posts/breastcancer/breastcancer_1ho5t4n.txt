I have TNBC, and have gone through 4 cycles of pacli plus carbo and next gonna go through 4 cycles of AC. After the chemo how much time does the surgery and radiation take? I just want to be done as soon as possible and want to know when all this will be over :(. I know chemo ends mid March but what about the rest can anyone tell me?
