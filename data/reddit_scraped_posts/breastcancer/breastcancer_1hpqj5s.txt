A rock hit my car about 5 hours into a long road trip. I've watched it go from a small starburst to a 20 inch crack in 3 days. I've been marking it daily and it has grown 1-2 inches per day. I have 4 days and about 1000 miles until I return home. I would prefer to have it repaired at home. I just want to confirm it will be safe to drive on the highway at 70-80 mph for 1000 miles. I'm not too worried about visibility, as it is in the lower 1/3 of the window, I'm more concerned about pressure/ glass integrity. Should I get some crazy glue and glue it as a temp fix before it spreads further? Would love any feedback from this sub!
