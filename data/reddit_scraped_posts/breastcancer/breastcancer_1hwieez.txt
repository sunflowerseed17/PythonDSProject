I have had a migraine from the time my chemo treatment stopped and is continuing onto today, Day 10.
Monday night,  I had such a horrible migraine (I was previously able to treat them) that I couldnâ€™t sleep as my head hurt so bad.  Tuesday I stayed in bed all day, in the dark and it wasnâ€™t until I took one of my hubbies codone pills that I could get to sleep.  Today I am still having a lingering migraine but it is much better.

To top it off, I got up yesterday (Tuesday) with the sorest throat ever.  My nodes are swollen and hurt to touch.

I had called the on call oncologist number yesterday am and (it wasnâ€™t my doc) but he said there wasnâ€™t anything he could do for me. ðŸ˜©

Any tips or experiences of these symptoms?
