I never celeberated Christmas. However, this year, it hits me differently. I was not a party girl, but seeing insta stories hit me differently. I was content with my life and was happy where I was before cancer, but having no life, no celeberation, going day by  day with mild neuropathy and nausea, staying home because of feeling tired and my low immune system due to chemo, hit me differently.

However, I want to make my favorite pasta tomorrow. I want somehow to celeberate. I still deserve to feel joy, with basic things. I feel loved by being under my blanket hugging my body pillow. It feels like a cuddle. I want to give the love I feel in my heart to you all. 

I want you, specially the ones who are going under active treatment like me, to share how can you give your self love and joy tonight and or tomorrow, share it here, and spread love to yourself and all sisters and brothers in this supportive loving group of adorable people who helped us.
