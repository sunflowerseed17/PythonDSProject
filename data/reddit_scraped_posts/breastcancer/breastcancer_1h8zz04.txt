Dcis and idc
Hello I am newly diagnosed with a large area of dcis and idc stage 2 grade 2. Triple positive.

Currently just had my first round of chemotherapy out of 6 and struggling mentally to be positive.

I know everyone will have fear of recurrences and I'm struggling with that. But I'm also struggling with being positive I just keep thinking when I get surgery they are going to tell me there is more or it's in my lymph nodes. I had an ultra sound, ct scan and mri with contrast and they say they are happy its contained but I just can't help but fear they are going to tell me differently at the end.

After I have done the chemotherapy I am having surgery on my left breast cause of the area of dcis I have to have a mastectomy and I am going to be opting for a double mastectomy and reconstruction (not sure what type of reconstruction yet) I am 30 years old and I would like to reduce my chances of anything growing in the other breast..

Has anyone been in similar situations or have any stories ?

Thanks
