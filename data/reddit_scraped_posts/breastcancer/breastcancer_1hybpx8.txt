Last year I was diagnosed with bilateral IDC ++-, left side one tumor size 18mm grade 2, right side two tumors sizes 16mm and 20mm, both grade 3.  When we were reviewing my results, my care team noted that I had mildly enlarged mammary lymph chain on the right side, but not to worry about it at the moment.  It got dropped along the way (I was so overwhelmed with all the information!) but now months later, I’m reviewing my reports and noticed it again.  I meet with my oncologist in two weeks and will ask about it, but I’m curious as to what this means, and do I need to be worried?  Has anyone else had this in their initial pathology reports?
