I had a consult with a surgeon today who said my cancer was really aggressive because it's still palpable.  My pathology report has the grade as 1.  I did 4 AC infusions and 5 taxol infusions; I have 7 more taxol infusions left and the size has already shrunk considerably.  My understanding is that chemo rarely makes tumors completely non palpable.  Is this other people's understanding and is it weird for a surgeon to say you have a really aggressive cancer because it's still palpable when you're in chemo (even when your pathology says it's grade 1)?  I'm not sure my comfort level with this surgeon.
