So I often think about Peter and his cats and I wonder:

Did he sing to them?
Did he ever say the words: toe beans, chop rubs and floofy?
Did he talk to them in a funny voice and call them by other names like ‘little miss moo’ , ‘pooper’ or ‘boo boo’?
Did he show the rest of the band photos of his cats? 

I will never know the answer to these questions but I hope the answer would be yes to all. 

I would have loved to hear Peter say: toe beans.
