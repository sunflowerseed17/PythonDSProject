Hi everyone, Iâ€™m sorry we meet like this but am so grateful this community exists!

I am 48 yrs, no bc family history. Very small group of micro calcifications found in upper outer quadrant of left breast. Biopsy came back as DCIS. Radiologist on the phone said no evidence of invasive cancer, however I will  need a lumpectomy and likely radiation. Total shock, but it is what it is. Now reading the pathology report, it says itâ€™s solid type, high grade. She did not mention this at all! Now the new report says ER+ 50%, PR+ 30% both 3+ nuclear staining. All I see when I look up high grade is that this is very aggressive. Why no mention of this on the phone? I am absolutely terrified, canâ€™t stop crying, waking up every hour with extreme anxiety. I donâ€™t know how to cope with this. I am so unfamiliar with all of these terms, I donâ€™t know what to make of it. I donâ€™t know what the numbers mean. I am scared for my 9 year old son, that he wonâ€™t have me much longer. I am just so lost and terrified. I have an appointment with a breast surgeon 1/16. I just have no idea what to expect and right now I can only think of the worst scenarios. Sorry for the long post and thanks for listening.
