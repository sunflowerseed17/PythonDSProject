I'm not sure if I can post this here or not, but no problem if you need to remove it Mods! Anyway, just something I noticed, and have thought about this before, but P seems like he was actually pretty smiley and a lot more happy-ish when he was younger. He seemed to be a pretty happy baby, and maybe even more interactive and responsive. Unfortunately, I feel like his overall demeanor took a dive when London was born and he wasn't the center of attention anymore, and that can definitely happen. I think he definitely has some resentment towards her, though. Also, the longer he's been alive, the more he's he's been exposed to Paris' constant chaos and erratic behavior. I dunno, was just wondering if anyone else noticed this or had similar thoughts. 

Also, WTH is going on at 1:06 where it looks like she's nursing? Is that actually one if those nursing setups like for dads? Or, I don't know. I know i need new glasses, but I can't for the life of me figure out what's actually going on in that pic??
