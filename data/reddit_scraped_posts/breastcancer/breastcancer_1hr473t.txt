I'm halfway through my chemo and looking into whether I'm eligible for a blue badge, as some friends who've been through breast cancer in other parts of the country have told me I should be. However, on the .gov portal under the question "Do you have a disability or condition that means you need a Blue Badge?" if I say my condition is expected to improve within 3 years, it says I'm not eligible. However, once you are diagnosed with cancer you're legally considered disabled for the rest of your life in the UK, aren't you? 

I guess I'm just not sure what 'condition' means on the .gov webpage. I certainly hope that my treatment is successful and I can go back to a relatively normal life within three years, but I'm not able to say if that definitely will happen. 

Sorry this is a bit rambling, has anyone got any experience with this?
