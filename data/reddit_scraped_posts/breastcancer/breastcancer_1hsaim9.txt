Hi everyone! ❤️

I was reading a few posts here and you lovely people convinced me that, in 2025, I’m really going to make an effort to exercise more consistently and more often than I was doing before. There were a few posts about the importance of exercise and I’ve been totally swayed. Been trying to go for walks as long as I can and I’m going to really try to get my steps in every single day as well as doing yoga (which I did before).

What are the healthiest habits you’ve adopted since your diagnosis? I’d love to learn from you all. I quit drinking which was honestly a big one for me, and started eating way healthier than I was in my 20s which I can feel the difference of already. 
For context I was first diagnosed in 2023, - - HER2 positive. Did AC and taxol, a lumpectomy and radiation. Even though it’s been 2 years since my diagnosis and 7 months since I finished herceptin I’m always looking for ways to reduce my risk of recurrence.

I know good eating/exercise/cutting out any vices (alcohol, smoking) is a good starting point but anything else that I’m missing? Physical health and mental health tips would be so appreciated!! 

Love you all! And thank you in advance!
