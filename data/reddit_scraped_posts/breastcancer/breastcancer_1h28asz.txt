I have been prescribed Anastrozole. I have it but have not started it yet. I need to start it soon because I see my oncologist soon and she’s going to ask. Does anyone know if side effects are lessened if it’s taken at night vs morning, or vice versa? Any hints on what has helped you while taking it? I am 69 if that makes any difference……
