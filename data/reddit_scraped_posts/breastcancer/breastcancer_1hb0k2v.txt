First had a mammogram the last week of October. Had another one the following week, with an ultrasound immediately after that. Surgeon came in and he recommended a biopsy, so two weeks later I had one. Yup, itâ€™s cancer. Last week was my MRI, and yesterday was my consult with the surgeon. My lumpectomy will be scheduled for the second week in January and it was be a couple weeks after that, that I meet with the oncologist. Does that sound right? 

Also, the surgeon is who has already started me on tamoxifen.
