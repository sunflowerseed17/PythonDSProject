I've had what I thought was fissures since my first TCHP. I saw today that I have a hemorrhoid (and probably a fissure) and they don't seem to improve. The chemo is causing more constipation for me than diarrhea and it's been difficult trying to combat it. For those who had to deal with this side effect, does it go away or improve once chemo is done. I hate that I'm practically crapping shards of glass and bleeding when I go. Today was the first time I went since Sunday and it was not fun...

Ps - there were numerous recommendations for a bidet when I started chemo which I did purchase. It's wonderful and refreshing when I'm sitting there in tears from any bowel movement.
