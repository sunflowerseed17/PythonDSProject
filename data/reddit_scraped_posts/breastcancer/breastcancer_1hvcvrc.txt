I just finished radiation at the end of December. On Friday, I went to a movie with my mom and daughter and I wasn’t wearing my prosthetic boob because my skin looks like raw hamburger. My mom made some comment about how I “need” to wear my boob at work because I’m so busty I look really lopsided without it.  

Today was my first day back from winter break (I’m a teacher), and as I was getting ready, my mom’s comment popped into my head. I wore the prosthetic. It was uncomfortable all day.

When I got home and took it out, I was bleeding. It’s minor, really. Just a scab rubbed off, but it gave me a scare. I’m so mad that I let her comment get to me. I’m an adult and I shouldn’t care what other people think. This is my body now and there’s no reason to be ashamed or cause myself pain to hide it. 

I’m mad at my mom for making such an insensitive comment, but I’m also mad at myself. She didn’t force me to wear it. She wouldn’t have seen me today. I wore it because I’m insecure about the way I look and I prioritized that over my health. Anyway, no more boob until my skin heals.
