Hi all, I have no clue what I am doing!

I have never done anything to my brows and don’t usually do much or any make up. I always have had straight bangs, so my eyebrows were covered. I recently lost my hair to chemo, so now my “secret garden” of brows are totally exposed. I am thankful that I kept my brows and eyelashes, but I’m finishing chemo soon and will be back to work.

I’m feeling really self-conscious about having no hair, so I want to do something to enhance my brows and face so I can get some confidence back. I just have NO idea where to start. YouTube and Google are overwhelming.

What I want is to embrace the thickness of my brows, but I’m hoping for something I can do in 5 mins or less as I get up early for work (I’m an educator). Any advice for this struggling cancer girlie?

TIA!
