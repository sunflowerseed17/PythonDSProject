I had breast conserving surgery the end surgery of November with a follow up surgery for better margins the end of December (turned out to have been unneeded as everything came back clear).  I have a lot of scar tissue (pecan sized in the breast) which is just so annoying because I really feel it.  I donâ€™t care about surface appearance but how it feels so hard and lumpy, I am just too aware of it when I move.  I think my tendency for excess scar tissue formation is a big part of my axilla neuropathy too (axilla not so lumpy as it only had single surgical access) and the neuropathy is very slowly improving with time.  So far doctors act like scar tissue is normal and I am just someone who forms a lot of it... but it irritates me.

Anyone else?  What did you do for it?  
Anyone with experience using shock/soft wave therapy?
