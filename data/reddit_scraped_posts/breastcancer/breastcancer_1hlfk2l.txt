Hello again! Last night was especially hard. Itâ€™s been a few days since diagnosis and I still have not been able to get anxiety and sleeping meds. I tried to do something in the meantime and took some sleep gummies and it really backfired. I had the most awful intrusive thoughts and I didnâ€™t sleep at all. Please share your positive stories with me. I really need a reminder that this is not a death sentence and I will get to see my little guys grow up. ðŸ¥º
