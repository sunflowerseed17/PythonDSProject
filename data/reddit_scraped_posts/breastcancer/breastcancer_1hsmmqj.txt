Hey y'all. I'm new here. I'm 42 and have NF1. I have been pretty healthy my whole life as far as NF is concerned. No major issues. Well last month I went for a mammogram and they found a suspicious spot that turned out to be malignant. Thankfully it's only stage 1. My breast are full of fibromas inside and below the skin so it's hard to keep track of any new ones. Have any of you ever been diagnosed with breast cancer? Just wondering how common it is for NF. They are doing some genetic testing to help decide which surgery to choose. Thanks!
