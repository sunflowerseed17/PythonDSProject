This question has been asked before but it's been a couple of years so was hoping for current info. 

Anyone know of a place in Tulsa that will refill CO2 for soda stream canisters? I saw that welding shops can do it but then also saw to not use them for consumption fills- idk if that's right or not! 

Thank you!!!
