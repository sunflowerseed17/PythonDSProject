I’m 50 , and was diagnosed and treated for stage zero dcis. I do consider myself lucky to have a treatable breast cancer. But I have been on tamoxifen for a year. I eat healthy, exercise regularly, worked with a dietitician. But I continue to put on weight, when I see photos of myself- my face is so puffy. I used to feel good about my looks but now not at all. I’m also tired and achy all the time and so not have the energy to match my drive. I am wondering if it’s worth it. It is making me so depressed, deleting myself out of my photo reel because I hate my face .
