Hi. I just started Chemo on the 27th. Keytruda, Taxol, and Carbo. First session went really well. Other than constipation and fatigue, I haven’t really felt anything. Pre-diagnosis I was extremely active at my gym. Now I’m nervous I can’t go to the gym any more. I’m afraid of the weight gain if I don’t workout. I’m also a diabetic so working out is very important to me. My mental health also benefits from a good sweat. 

How have you handled this? 

I’m terrified I’ll catch something and get sick. Let’s just say I’m terrified of everything these days.
