I find out my biopsy results Tuesday- I am a no rad 5. I know in my gut it is likely C but I can't stop obsessing about it. I haven't done anything over the last two weeks except stress eat and lay in my pajamas. I'm not being a good mom. I go from thinking worst case scenario to best. Some days I think I'm dying. Any help to get out of this head space?
