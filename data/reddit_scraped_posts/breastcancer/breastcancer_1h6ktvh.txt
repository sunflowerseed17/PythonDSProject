We're out here trying to change hateful people and we all know haters are gonna hate. So, I'm realizing I WANT to know if someone is racist so I can choose to distance myself. I WANT to see a business owner wear their MAGA hat so I can take my business elsewhere. 

I want to know exactly where you stand - so I can find another place to stand.

We're never going to be able to change the world - too many people need hate to live - so let's be open about our hatred. So instead of fighting it out and people being "closeted" about their hate ... I want them out with it.
