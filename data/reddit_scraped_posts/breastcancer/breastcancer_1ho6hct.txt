I was diagnosed on 30th October (confirmed 19th Nov) with breast cancer. The prognosisis is good so my mood hasn't been too bad. I had my first chemo last Monday and my mood has dropped hugely. It's frustrating as having struggled with depression in the past I really don't want to go back there.  I feel like I have 0 energy which probably doesn't help.  Any top tips for staying positive?
