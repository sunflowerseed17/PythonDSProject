My last 4/4 infusions is tomorrow. Someone asked me if I am bringing a gift. She told me about the very kind and thoughtful baskets she put together for 25 nurses. She was on the same center but for a lot lot longer. 

I donâ€™t even feel like I know them. The center is like a cattle call of more people than they have staff to care for. My MO went it on leave and tomorrow will be the first time I see her since before I started. My infusion nurse must have 3 patients because she is always on the run. She peeks and and asks me if I want a warm blanket Iâ€™m always grateful for that but when the pole is beeping sheâ€™s nowhere and another nurse comes in and reluctantly manages the noise and annoyingly asks the other nurses where she is. I loved my surgeon and my plastic surgeon and I hugged them on my last visit, I was so  damn grateful I told them several times I think they got it I think I professed love for my plastic surgeon, and perhaps got his front office assistant a raise because I gushed about her she was AWESOME  loved the PA.ðŸ˜€but it never occurred to me to buy a gift.  I donâ€™t feel the same energy in the infusion center. Iâ€™m moving to a closer hospital for RT so my treatment has been at 3 hospitals.  And the medical oncology kind of drives me crazy with chaos and lack of response. If I had more than 4 infusions I would change. I guess that says it all but yet now I feel like a gift is the status quo. I may bring or to my surgeon though! Thoughts? Did anyone not gift their care givers?
