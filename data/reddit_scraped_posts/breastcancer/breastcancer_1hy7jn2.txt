I had a seroma that got infected in October and had surgery to drain it. The incision is not healing and I have been under the care of my surgeon and my hospital’s wound care center since then. 
Wound care nurse and the surgeon give me conflicting care guidelines. The surgeon says to change the dressing daily and let it get wet in the shower. The wound care nurse says to change dressings three times a week and to keep it dry. 
We tried packing with all kinds of materials but it’s not healing. 
Do I look for another wound care center?  
Do I find another surgeon? 
Not sure which way to go with this. 
Any advice is welcomed
