I have been recently diagnosed with invasive ductile cancer.  I am still in the process of getting more tests and meeting my team. The two I have met both agree that the surgery should be done before treatment.  I am leaning toward a double mastectomy.  I just can't decide if I want reconstructive surgery and end up around A or B (currently a more voluptuous size)or just go flat?

I think I just want to go flat.  But I do have a husband and I think he would like at least a little bit in the end.  He is very supportive and ultimately the decision is up to me.

What did you ultimately decide on?  Would you have gone another route knowing what you know now?

How  did it affect you mentally?   Did it take time to adjust to seeing a flat chest with just scars?

If yall have spouses/significant others, what were their takes on it?

I know the decision is mine and mine alone, but I would like some feedback on others mindsets that have been through this difficult decision.
