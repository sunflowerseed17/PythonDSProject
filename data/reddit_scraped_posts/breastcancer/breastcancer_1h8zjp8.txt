Finished my 6 rounds of TCHP chemo, and immediately I’m on to the next round…this time just continuing on with HP. I keep hearing that it’s not actually “chemo” and much easier, but really what should I expect? I know I no longer need to cold cap, but what are the realistic side effects? Doesn’t Herceptin cause a lot of heart problems? What should I ask my oncologist about? Thanks sisters!
