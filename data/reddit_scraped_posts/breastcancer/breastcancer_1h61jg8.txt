Hi. I have a 6th grader who is currently homeschooling. She went to a montessori school from PreK-2nd grade. From 2nd grade-4th grade she was in public school. In 5th grade, we put her back in the montessori school. During her time at the montessori school, they were concerned about her attention and ability to understand. I took her to a nueropsychologist who concluded that she has slow cognitive tempo, which is a type of ADHD. 

Anyways, so we decided to homeschool her and get a private tutor for math and writing. She is doing much better with math and writing. For social studies, I got a workbook that she does daily. For English, we do novel studies. I was using Blossom and Root as the curriculum. I was also using Blossom and Root and doing Oceanography with her. 

I am not sure if I am doing enough. She pretty much finishes her work within 2 hours and the rest of the day wants to play or watch tv. Is there anything else I can add on? I am looking for a more intensive science program and English. Any recommendations for a student that needs more time to understand things. TIA!
