Anyone else out there dealing with nausea and a 'full' stomach feeling even after your treatment ended? I finished chemo in fall 2022, radiation in winter 2023 and Herceptin/Perjeta in summer 2023. I was diagnosed with gastroparesis (thanks, chemo) in winter 2024. After trying a few different nausea meds, it seemed to get better, but about a month ago, the nausea/fullness came roaring back. It's constant, uncomfortable, and I don't want to eat or drink, because anything I put in my body makes it worse. I'd welcome all insight and related experiences here; thanks!
