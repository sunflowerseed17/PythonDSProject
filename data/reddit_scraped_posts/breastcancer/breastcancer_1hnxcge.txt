I am 40f and was diagnosed in Nov. 28 with ++- IDC. I got my single mastectomy on Dec. 18. Today I was prepared for sleep, but I wnet to check ‚ÄúMyChart‚Äù and the results from surgical pathology was there:

Final Diagnosis:
A. LEFT SENTINEL NODE #1   -3 lymph nodes are identified and 1  lymph node reveals
macrometastasis.  Metastatic deposit measures 11 mm.  Focal perinodal soft tissue
invasion is seen (1 mm)
B. LEFT SENTINEL NODE #2  -single lymph node is negative for metastatic malignancy
c. LEFT BREAST, STITCH IS SHORT SUPERIOR LONG LATERAL
-Invasive ductal carcinoma
-Tumor is intermediate grade with total score of 6 of 9 (2+3+1)
-Lymphovascular space invasion is identified
-Carcinoma is widely and completely excised

I am terrified about macrometastasis in a lymph node. I cannot sleep anymore. I am crying like a baby. I just need a support from this group! üò≠
