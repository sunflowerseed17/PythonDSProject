Hello! Last week (12/12) I successfully underwent a double mastectomy. I'm healing pretty well and my pain seems to be getting better every day. Today, I had a post op appointment with my Medical Oncologist that has made me both sad and scared. We went over my post surgery pathology and there were more infected lymph nodes than initially thought (for context, I had chemo prior to surgery). When I was initially diagnosed Stage 3, Grade 1, ++-. Upon diagnosis, doctors suspected around 1-3 lymph nodes involved. Post surgery, 5 lymph nodes are involved - all with macrometasteses and around 2mm of extranodal extension. Additionally, I received a Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) score of 3. When I asked the doctor about my RCB score, she explained that it references the amount of cancer still present at surgery. While I understand all of this, I am really freaked out about the RCB score and my lymph nodes. Everything that I have read says that an RCB score of 3 is a negative prognostic factor. Not to mention the macrometasteses in my lymph nodes. My doctor told me that I did have a response to chemo, but I guess that I thought I was expecting some sort of miracle. I am so terrified about my RCB score. Now I can't help but think that I did surgery, cancer, and future radiation just for this stupid disease to come back. I hate this so much. I hate that I will have to live the rest of my life on the edge. I was diagnosed at 35, currently 36 and I just feel like I have been robbed of my life. I haven't had a chance to be married or have children yet and I feel like I can't plan for the future. I just want to live to be an old lady.
