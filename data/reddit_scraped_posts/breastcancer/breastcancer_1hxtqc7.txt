I had had double mastectomy on October 2023. When I said to the surgeon I wanted double mastectomy and no reconstruction he didn't try to change my mind but he never offered me the chance to have Aesthetic Flat Closure. I'm finding out about this option only now, I mean really now. I heard about it last week for the very first time and I had to google it to know what it was. 
It's frustrating because I have been butched.
