3 of our 4 kids live out of state (2/3 are biologically mine). My kids have been very standoffish since my diagnosis. It has hurt - a lot. I know it’s their way of processing…but it has hurt. 

Over the last few days I have FaceTimed with both of my kids. My son saw me in a scarf and was ok - my daughter wanted to see me bald…I was scared to show her, but she was ok. I know this all made it more real for them, but they truly seemed ok - and I think it sunk in how hard this really is on my end. 

I have missed my kids desperately - just the regular conversations. I feel like we needed to cross this barrier. I know they are always on my side, but no one wants to see mom sick (they are 24 and 29). Mom is the one who holds shit together. Mom doesn’t break down. Mom just keeps pushing forward. They have been scared and worried as I have been for them. 

Tonight perhaps I will rest easier.  The bandaid has been ripped off.
