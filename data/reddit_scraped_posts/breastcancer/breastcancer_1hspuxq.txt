Well the perfect storm has occurred I got laid off from my company of 17years in September and got a nice package and said I would wait until the new year to start looking for a job to enjoy some time home with the kids I have been working since I was 18 figured I would take advantage of the time. Christmas Eve got diagnosed with IDC 10mm ++-. Seeing the surgeon next week. Has anyone navigated job search and treatment? How is that even possible? Would anyone hire me? Iâ€™m 41 and not working is not an option.
