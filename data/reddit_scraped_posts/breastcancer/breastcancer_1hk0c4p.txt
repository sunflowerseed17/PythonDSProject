I’m trying to come up with good ideas for Christmas for my best friend approx $25 or less. We’re mid-30s ladies and she’s always been amazing. This year, she really showed up for me and supported me during my breast cancer battle and I want to get something special. I do plan to include a letter of gratitude with all the reasons I love and appreciate her. 

She doesn’t drink alcohol. She is a teacher and already gets tons of edible treats from students. She likes coffee (but also gets lots of coffee-related gifts). We share a favorite sports team, but I’ve done lots of gifts related to this in the past. 

She likes to travel, loves Jesus, reading, board games, puzzles, (I’ve got her games and puzzles in the past), easy hiking/picnics (I got her a hiking backpack cooler before), singing and playing instruments, scrapbooking, and has a cat and a husband.
