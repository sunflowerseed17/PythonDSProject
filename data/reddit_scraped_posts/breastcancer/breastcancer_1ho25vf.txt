About 2 weeks ago I was diagnosed with triple negative grade 3 with at least one lymph node involved. Since yesterday it started hurting and feeling swollen and tender which isn't a feeling I had before. I contacted my oncologist office and they said he wasn't going to be back till Monday. They asked if I wanted them to contact the on call doctor and I said yes but never heard back. I just woke up and it's way more noticeable now. Is this normal? Is this something that can wait till morning or Monday and I just take ibuprofen and ice it or should I be going to the ER? Has anyone else experienced swelling and pain before treatment?

Update: In perfect timing my MRI results came in. The lymph node is pressing into my pec which is explaining why it's now hurting (not a lot but enough to worry me into thinking it wasn't normal) ibuprofen and waiting for chemo for the tumors to shrink is the plan.
