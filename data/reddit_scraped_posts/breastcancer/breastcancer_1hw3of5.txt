I’m done with active treatment and now on Anaztrozle and verzenio. Since chemo, my ovary removal and these meds sex has been painful. I’ve talked to my obgyn and oncologist but both were less than helpful. What solutions have people used. I am estrogen positive so that also may be why they didn’t give me much.
