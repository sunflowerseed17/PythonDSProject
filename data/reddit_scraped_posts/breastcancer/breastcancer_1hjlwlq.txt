I still haven't had my chemo teach and am wondering if I'm allowed to bring someone to this? I've kept my boyfriend uninvolved with my appointments up until now, but I'm starting to think that may not have been wise as I don't think he 'gets' the severity of this whole thing. Do you think it might be helpful to have him there so he understands what I'm about to go through?
