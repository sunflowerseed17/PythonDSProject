Today I feel tired, weak and very emotional. I have called my doctors because when I go pee, there is blood in it. The nurse messaged me and said it could be normal from the chemo but I am experiencing a little discomfort so I called back again just to be double sure I just feel so angry and I don’t wanna be going through this and I know there are some people who have probably felt so much worse than I do right now and mentally I’m just really struggling.
