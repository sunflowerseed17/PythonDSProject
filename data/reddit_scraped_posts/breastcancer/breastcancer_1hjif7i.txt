I initially had implants put in last week after my dmx. However the non cancer breast became necrotic. Had to get implants removed yesterday and now I’m flat. They added so much gauze to the surgical bra. It was so painful, so I removed some of the gauze. Making the bra less painful. It’s the weekend so the plastic surgeon’s office is closed. Anyone experienced 
with this? Was it ok for me to remove some of the gauze so soon? The bra was as loose as it can be on the first clamp. But it seems they put a whole role of gauze.
