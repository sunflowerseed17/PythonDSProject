Diagnosed with IDC, ER/PR+, HER2-, grade 2, Stage II about a month ago and I was feeling so good about how I’ve been managing the anxiety during all of this… 

The plan is surgery, (DMX—I want aesthetic flat closure—no implants) followed
by chemo after recovery from surgery. 

It’s been almost a month since I’ve spoken to anyone on my medical team. I only had an initial meeting with the breast surgeon and oncologist—it was head-spinning. There was a vague mention of the surgery maybe being scheduled for late January but they can’t schedule it until I meet with the plastic surgeon… Holidays, vacations, etc, etc, today was my appointment (it has been looming so large for weeks!)—a couple of hours before, I got a call—it’s rescheduled for Monday. I had a little meltdown. I KNOW it’s not a big deal… 

I’ve been stressed about not having a start date and just a vague, uncertain timeline. I’m increasingly fixated on this fear that they won’t be able to schedule the surgery until later than the original estimate. I know rationally not to fear the cancer spreading as I wait—I know it’s slow moving. 
I’m worried about how I’ll handle the anxiety of waiting. I have a job that I’ll have to take a full leave from throughout treatment. Logistically, it would be very helpful to have a timeline sooner rather than later. I’ll want to/need to work right up until the surgery, but it’s becoming increasingly hard to manage work with my emotions and anxiety. 

I know this is not unusual—everyone did say the hardest part is all the waiting. I’m thankful I have this space to vent. xxo
