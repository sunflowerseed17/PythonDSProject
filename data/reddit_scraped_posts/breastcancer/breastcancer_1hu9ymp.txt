Hi! Any experience you want to share is welcome. I was very happy to get a port, since my chemo doesn't have an end date (MBC). The port was inserted 6 weeks ago. The entry wound was healing slowly, but overall it seemed fine and it was used successfully for 3 weekly chemos. 

2 weeks ago, the skin over the port looked really red. My Dr prescribed one antibiotic (Bactrim). Then added Cipro. No improvement. I'm now about to finish oral Zyvox. Still looks bad. No fever, no abscess, just the redness over the port. 

Anybody had a similar complication? Had to have the port removed? Could it be an immune response (body rejecting the port)?
