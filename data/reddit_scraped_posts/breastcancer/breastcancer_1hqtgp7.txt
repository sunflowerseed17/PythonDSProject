Hey yall,

im 19… was diagnosed back in November with DCIS, im scheduled to have a BMX + implant reconstruction on the 7th. But at all of my appointments the doctors never questioned me on smoking / drinking and if they did i probably wasn’t truthful… on my surgery date it will be exactly 2 weeks cold turkey for me for Vaping. i also have been drinking a shit ton of water daily, eating a lot of fruits / veggies with antioxidants that support detoxification and blood circulation. I also work out heavily! Do yall think I would still be good for surgery on the 7th or should I call my doctor beforehand to possibly be rescheduled?
