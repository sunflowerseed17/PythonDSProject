So hair is down to baby duck fuzz - nut apparently all of the little follicle pieces are now coming out. They look like itty bitty hole punch holes - perfectly round, white, and tiny. 

I bought about 10 different scalp care products that Iâ€™m testing out - hopefully at least I can get the scaly part under control. Ugh!!!!!
