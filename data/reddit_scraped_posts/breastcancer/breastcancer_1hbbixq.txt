Hello all! 

My five year old learns at home for the time being. I am a visual artist and so naturally my daughters experiences include a ton of art mediums and use of visual aids we create as part of learning. 

Our rule has always been that she can create things her own way, including ignoring instructions and breaking logic(purple duck, for instance). 

The exception to that is a creative activity that requires us to make things a certain way in order to learn something. But that… is almost impossible to communicate to her. 

Lately she enjoys pushing back on a lot of things, which is fine, but this has started to include disrupting activities meant to teach through play. Example: we’re meant to be seeing how the scarf floats when tossed in the air. The intent is to discuss its movement and just have a conversation. 

She’ll refuse tossing and insist the scarves are going to be used for tying around her stuffy’s neck and playing pretend. There is pretty much no going back to the intended activity, though I can get her if I try again the next day. 

But I think about classroom settings and this is where I wonder what would be done with her reaction in that setting. How would professionals cope with a child that refuses to do the activity or needs to be convinced in one way or another to follow directions?
