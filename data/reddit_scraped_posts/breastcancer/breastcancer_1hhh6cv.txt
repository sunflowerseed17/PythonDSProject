Alright so I have severe anxiety and I’m prescribed 1mg clonazepam, 1mg lorazepam in the morning and the same at night, both 1mgs of those meds. Honestly I have trouble always prescribing them the way they are supposed to be prescribed and have had incident where I took too much.

My tolerance seems to be super high because I can do 10-12mg of either kpins or Ativan and still be normal, I just feel relaxed and sedated. I’ve taken 20mg of kpins once which was a mistake because I blacked out. But anything under 20mg it seems I can do no problem. I take tolerance breaks between my refills which I know is dangerous because of WDs but I taper off.

I know I said like a weirdo and it is but I just want to know how bad this situation is or if others can tolerate/take the same amount? 

Thank you all in advance
