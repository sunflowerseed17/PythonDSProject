Hi everyone,

I've been on tamoxifen for a little over 3 weeks. I'll see my Onco in a few weeks for my first appt since starting. I messaged his team when the joint pain started, and he suggested Vitamin D which I've been taking but haven't noticed it lessening. I'm also going to ask him about changing brands.

Side effects are fatigue and a decent amount of joint and muscle pain. Did this get better for anyone over time? I've read that some of the side effects do lessen after a month or 6 months. When it's cold and rainy, I feel pretty bad. Yoga helps more than anything else (besides pain meds, but I don't want those to be something I turn to easily). I'm also getting massages from hubs, swim, and I need to start doing weight-bearing exercises. 

I've also read that acupuncture might help as well as official massages, so I'm going to see if insurance might cover those. Has anyone had experience with insurance covering these?

The CYP2D6 test to see if the tamoxifen is working - I am committed to taking it because I want no regrets, but not if it's not actually working. Since I have definite side effects, does that mean it's definitely working? Google isn't helping me much here.

  
Thanks, friends.
