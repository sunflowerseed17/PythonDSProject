I had my meeting with my SO before surgery this week and see my plastic surgeon in the new year. 

My SO suggested doing a SMX right now with radition and a DMX doesn't change much other than me getting a new breast cancer. He told me I need to wait a year before reconstruction, due to rads which would start in Feb. Then if I wanted to do both sides they can do it at the same time.

So in the mean time I would like to try a prosthetic, I've seen some online and we have actual stores that also sell them... any suggestions? I've seen these and not sure? They are a bit pricey but I can get it covered. Would it be better to just go in?
