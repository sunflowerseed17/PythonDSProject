Diagnosed stage 1C in January of 2024. DMX March 1, started chemo late April (TC x4) because of my age (37 at the time) and oncotype score of 20. I finished chemo in late June, had my reconstruction in late September and started to feel nauseous at night around October but chalked it up to everything I’ve been through. Now I have zero appetite like zilch which is very unlike me (I’m always pretty hungry despite being very normal weight of 135 at 5’6”) I am panicking and basically wondering if anyone had a similar situation and it turned out to be nothing? I have an MRI of my abdomen on Jan 22 to check out a spot on my liver that is thought to be a benign hemangioma but I am freaking out over here.
