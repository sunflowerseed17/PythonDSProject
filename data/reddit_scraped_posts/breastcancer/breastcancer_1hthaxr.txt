I’m wondering if it’s important to you if people think your lab diamond is a naturally sourced stone or not? I’m assuming there’s stigma around a perceived “fake” just like there is with luxury hand bags. I can’t imagine people who carry a fake Birkin bag want everyone knowing it’s fake. Is it the same with lab diamonds?
