Going through chemo every couple weeks. Just finished first round and am on second week finally feeling like myself only.. when I was with my husband, I was literally numb inside. 

Of course, I had to fake it to help him out and we used lube because I was just not turned on so I was wondering is this permanent? Will my libido ever come back?

I feel so bad for faking ☹️ but I’m happy that he’s satisfied. Anybody???
