I am 58, with IDC ++-   Lumpectomy done.   About to beginning planning phase for radiation.  Had a baseline bone density and have osteoporosis.   So now what do they do about AI?   I haven’t heard from
anyone if I should start something now for it.  Just so discouraged.  

There is only so many times I can tell myself if could be worse.   Just because other people have it worse, and many of you do…… doesn’t mean I have it better.    Just different and still sucky.
