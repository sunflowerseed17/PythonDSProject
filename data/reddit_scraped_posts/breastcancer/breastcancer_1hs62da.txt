Just curious. For those of you who had TCHP and monthly injections for 5 years (where you still go to the infusion center), when did you ring the bell if you did ring it. After the 6 rounds of TC? After the year of HP infusions? After the 5 years of injections when it’s your last visit to the infusion center? 

Someone rang the bell while I was getting treatment today and it made me think about it. No one said anything to me about it after my last round of chemo. I’ll be done will HP in March. I’m 5 months into my 5 years of Zolodex injections and taking Letrozole. 

I love to hear others ring the bell and it always makes me tear up. Today was a little old lady just oozing with joy. I was so happy for her!
