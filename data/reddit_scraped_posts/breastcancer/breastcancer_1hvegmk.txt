Stage 1a IDC and DCIS. 51F. Two surgeries, rads and now a month of tamoxifen.  So far so good.  Had back pain, freaked out, but it was not tam.  Night sweats may be.  But generally, things are‚Ä¶ normal?  Just came back from a 5 day ski trip with my family and was totally shredding!  Was out on the mountain for 5-6 hours each day even though I had been doing just walks for exercise for months.  So pleased üòÄ. So now I just have an extra pill to pop for 5 years, fingers cross and hopefully live my life ‚ù§Ô∏è. Love and hope to all of you.
