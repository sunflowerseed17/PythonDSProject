I might be starting with radiation in 2-3 weeks. I've read here before that people started applying certain creams/lotions to the area that's supposed to be irradiated beforehand, and that helps with damage control. What can I do myself to mitigate the possible side effects of radiation to my skin and my body in general? 

Ps. I had a unilateral modified radial mastectomy on 31 Dec 2024 with ALND.

EDIT: I forgot to mention this but will I be required to stretch my arm above my head during the treatment? I am out of SMX and I can barely lift my arm above my shoulder right now!
