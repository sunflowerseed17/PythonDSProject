I have to do a lymph node biopsy next week and wondering if this is the same experience as a breast lump biopsy.  My breast lump biopsy was a horrible experience as they didn't put in enough freezing and I felt the bore needle go in and pull a piece of the tumor out.  It was traumatizing.  Is the lymph node needle the same? smaller?? I am stressing over this.
