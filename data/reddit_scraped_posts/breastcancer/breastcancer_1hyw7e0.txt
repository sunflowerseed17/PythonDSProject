How do you know when your expanders are a good size and you should stop? I had hoped that i could have gone directly to implants but no I woke from my surgery with expanders. To complicate matters a bit I have lost 50 lbs since my diagnosis, so my body is not the same (previously my bra size was 40C., PS said I was about 800-1000cc’s) I certainly don’t want to be bigger than I was, not sure I even want to be the same as before. I kind of like this small boobs, no bra life. Currently my expanders are at 360cc’s, I am thinking if I go until 600cc’s these boobs will be gigantic. 
How did you know when they were the right size? Do you regret going too big? Too small?
