My treatment plan is 3 x ordinary chemo with my THCP starting on the 4th cycle.

Tolerated first one, on NYE of all days, just fine only 10 mins of my scalp being ON FIRE and accidentally ripping off the bandage for my port removal, causing my bedside (I was warded, no room in daycare) to look like a slasher film.

Woke up bright and early, demolished a hotel breakfast (decided to check into a St Giles for peace and quiet).

My mother suddenly popping up situation was resolved with a brief visit to her hotel, everyone was masked so it’s all good.

Also crowdfunded enough to pay for a year of Herceptin so at least I have that load off my mind (old friends and clients came in clutch, I was crying for like days when their aid came in).

Was discharged with three vials of Neuropen after being warded for half a day with steroids, anti nausea and gastric pills and my bill for the day: 53 ringgit or US$12, which I can both claim as tax relief and be reimbursed by my workplace’s medical claims.

I also have a whole month off to just get used to my new cancer patient life. After the panic and financial fears of 2024, losing my cat and dog to old age and illness, I’m just glad 2025 is starting off decent.

Hugs to all, this Reddit helped keep my spirits up and make me feel less lost about everything.
