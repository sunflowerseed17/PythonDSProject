Title: Cheated on my wife years ago with a woman who was our friend. Her husband just died and she's reached out to both of us. AITA for feeling a little yucky when texting her back? I genuinely feel sorry for her and her kids, I'm just ashamed of how I went behind my wife's back a long time ago...
