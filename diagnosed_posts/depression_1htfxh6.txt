My girlfriend and I have been going through it some. Things have come up between us but we have been doing a better and better job communicating and learning how to work through things together. On top of this she has been having a hard time lately. I’ll be the first to admit that she has had it a lot harder in life than I have. When she was younger she had some of the worst loss someone can experience. More recently she has lost friends and really been growing and life is kicking her down. She is overwhelmed and really in her head. We both work a good bit but we have built a nice life and she seems to really be happy a lot of the time. She has been saying things like “can’t do this anymore” and “I just don’t want to exist” and it scares the hell out of me. I care about this girl deeply and I want the best for her. I am trying to work on getting her into her own therapist and I’m asking her how I can help. Any pointers or advice on how I can help her personally without overstepping or trying to take the place of a professional would be very appreciated.
