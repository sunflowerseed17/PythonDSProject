Feeling lost and need advice 



My end of December I was broken up with a few days after my birthday, Then my abusive dad had a heart attack and a few days later I ended up in the ER for 3 days with food poisoning . I got let go in July from my job most likely due to my disability and have since Been denied food stamps and govorment housing aid even though I need it bc I “make too much” . Am currently working a job my friend got me for $19 an hour which is nothing and am struggling greatly. Trying to get a career based job bc I need the security so badly and then my health has just been up and down since getting fired in July and losing some of my mobility. I really need to sue my old job but that’s the last thing on my mind right now. I’ve been trying to break things down into smaller pieces but it’s just too hard right now to do that when all my energy is going into staying alive and I feel like a failure and also so angry bc I wonder if I was more able bodied if things would be different but then I get really depressed knowing I’ll never be able bodied again and I just don’t know what to do. I feel SO lost in life rn . I’m also 8000 in debt that’s all in collections and one of my card companies is sueing me
