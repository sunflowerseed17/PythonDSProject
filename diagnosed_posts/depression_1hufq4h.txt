Im 22 and my younger sister is 15. The other day she told me I am the reason she cuts herself and this stemmed from me putting her clothes in her bedroom and not folding all her clothes. I told her she could put them in the dryer to fluff it back up for 10 min but it was wrinkled when i got to it anyways. She showed me her cuts and said "im gonna fucking kill you" i dont know what to do anymore. She hates therapy and medications and refuses to go outdoors. She has a strained relationship with everyone in the family and often closes herself off in her bedroom. I am planning to move out and she tells me if I do then she will blame me if she kills herself. I need some advice on how to approach this and how to be a better sister.
