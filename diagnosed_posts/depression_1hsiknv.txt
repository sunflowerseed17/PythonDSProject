Lately I've taken notice of how "lucky" I am compared to alot of people I see who have smiles I can't even fake.. at the same time I've realized that I am gaslighted by at least one person in any place I have to go (work, home,etc) I have moments where I think things are stable but it always comes crashing down on me. I haven't been in a relationship in over 8 years and wasted my youth doing nothing... I have nothing to show for my life. I honestly feel that people around me expected me to do end it a looong time ago as well... I'm overdue. I gave it my best. I swear I did. I tried everything... I'm gonna start prepping for the big day. If I find a reason I will postpone again... But I really just can't go on like this.... I can't cry anymore. I'm left with this cold numb feeling in head and chest. I feel like I am in slow motion. Like my head is full of honey and I'm an uneasy... I hope something takes me out naturally... I'm too much of a coward to do it myself...
