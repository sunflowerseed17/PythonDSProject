I became angry with the world after you
Because I saw you everywhere 
I saw you in the stars and in the faces on the street, hell I even felt you in the air
I think it’s because you were so good I couldn’t goodness beyond you anymore
Everything I loved everything I wanted you were in it and I’ve never felt that before 
So I became angry it’s sort of my default setting
When disappointment and hurt are too quiet and I’ve had enough of just regretting
I lash out like a wounded animal who’s limbs is caught in a trap as it’s flesh is shredding
And I want to say you were the trap even though I just gushed about how good you are
It’s funny I do that to twist the story in my head keep the truth fuzzy in the distance way to far
I can’t tell if I need you to be the victim or the villain 
Or if just need to rant and have someone sit and listen 
But I do know I’m angry and that is my final decision
