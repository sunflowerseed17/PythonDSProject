As of the 3rd of July I have been diagnosed with severe depression. Having the actually diagnosis feels a lot more scary than I thought it would. I think about it a lot, but I did before the diagnosis as well. In a couple weeks, I am starting treatment. I'm honestly scared. Is this truly something I can be treated for? Or do I just learn to live with it?
