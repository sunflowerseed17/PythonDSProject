I was telling my psychiatrist that recently I get these episodes of extreme sadness/hopelessness but it's very different then a panic attack (which I've suffered with for many years).it's called a anxious-depressive attack. It's an awful, can last minutes to hours. Apparently it's common in people who suffer with panic attack disorder.

It's a very intense feeling of anxiety and depression and negative thoughts. it can be very dangerous because many people self harm or overdose when they experience these episodes.

Has anyone heard of this? It's the first time for me.
