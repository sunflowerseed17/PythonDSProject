Hi I’m a 15yr male. my depression started at 10 yrs old and I every time I vent it either does not help or it is temporary relief but when it is temporary relief it comes back worse I’ve always thought no one genuinely cares and I’m the only one that cares about myself and I constantly mess up I wish i could disappear a lot so I can stop being constantly criticized for everything and I feel like I’m meaningless I stay up late because the pain is too much I feel helpless and I feel like im worthless and I can’t do anything right I have horrible social anxiety every single day I am so mentally drained but I can’t fix it with how much sleep it is please give me some advice
