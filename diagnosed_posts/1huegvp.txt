Lately, I’ve been feeling so overwhelmed, but I don’t even feel like I’m allowed to be depressed. I was diagnosed with severe depression when I was 13, and I’ve been unmedicated since then. I’ve been struggling with my self-esteem for as long as I can remember. I’ve always felt fat and ugly, and even though I’m working on losing weight now, I feel like it’s too late. My body will never be the same—there will be loose skin, and I can’t stop thinking about how hideous I’ll look.

I’ve tried talking to my partner about how I’m feeling, but I don’t think he really understands me. It’s hard because I feel like I’m not even allowed to take rest days or just exist without feeling judged.

I also know that other people have it so much worse than me, and that’s another reason I feel like I shouldn’t even allow myself to feel this way. I keep telling myself I should just suck it up and push through, but it’s exhausting.

Lately, I’ve noticed I might be getting a bit too comfortable with weed. It’s starting to feel like an escape from reality, where, for once, my thoughts feel organized and I can believe I’m in control of every aspect of my life. It’s like a break from all the chaos in my life. Other times i pretend I'm back in the past where it wasn't that bad.

I don’t know how to bring any of this up to anyone else without feeling like a burden, and honestly, I don’t want to. I just wish I could escape somewhere peaceful where I don’t have to worry about anything or anyone for a while. I feel so tired all the time. Not physically but mentally. How do I get past this? What do i do?

TL;DR: I’ve been struggling with self-esteem and depression since I was 13, and I’ve been unmedicated. I feel overwhelmed by my body and how it will change as I lose weight. I feel like I’m not allowed to be depressed because others have it worse, and I’m also worried I’m using weed too much as an escape. I don’t feel like I can talk to anyone without feeling like a burden. I just want peace and to be able to rest without judgment.
