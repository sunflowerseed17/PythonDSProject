(29f) Well, today was good since the new year I have been working on myself and making sure my mental health stays good but just from the last two weeks I'm already over everything. It started with my grandmother saying that mental illness isn't a thing and that I should somehow just get over it. My family keeps devaluing my job and not acknowledging my efforts to find a second one. (The job market is currently garbage in my area and I have to be mindful of my options to keep my mental health positive.) I'm to blame for literally every single problem my family is dealing with and I'm also the one who has to deal with my mom's mental health issues, eating disorder etc. and any issues my sister has also I have to be involved with my addicted older brother (who's the favourite). And the main suggestion is that I get rid of my ESA which is literally only thing that keeps me going on a regular TheSo my life is terrible, my family is terrible everything is terrible
