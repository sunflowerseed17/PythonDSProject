Since I was born Ive never been good at anything, I tried a few things hoping I would like it but gave up every time. And now I'm a 16 years old teen locked up in my room for the whole day without any hobby. 

My room is a mess, I shower once every week and barely brush my teeth. I spend my days on my phone or sleeping. I starve myself for my own validation, and even started scarification a year ago. 

The only times I go outside is for school, even if i find myself skipping a lot, or to buy drinks or stuff to cut myself with at the small grocery store next to my house. 

I hate how I live and would kill to have the same life as a random person in my school. I started contemplating suicide like two years ago, and if my life stays the same when i reach my 18th birthday I will not hesitate to kill myself. My life is miserable
