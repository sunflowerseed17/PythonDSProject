I was meant to die at 27 not before not after. And I'm 28 and I'm so fucking confused. So what now. I have no career. Everything  I did in life was rushed. Every choice was with the fact that I wasn't...but I am. God I am and I'm so fucking lost because wtf man like wtf you know. So now what. Now I live. I deal with my breakdowns and my mind. Like seriously, I'm a cutter but never taken that step and I'm like God. I'm drowning. Like what do I do now? Go to school? Like how do I deal with the realization that I live now?
