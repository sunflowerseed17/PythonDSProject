Hi,

I have no real friends. I have never had any. I have wasted nearly all my youth and the little I have left is doomed. The only people I talk to outside my family are my ex and one friend. I am a burden to them. They can't help me. When I'm not talking to them I feel empty. I am extremely codependent with my ex. I have nothing left to give. She is my only motivation. I lost everything. I got hit by a car, am three weeks behind in school, in a country whose language I don't speak. My family and I have no money or job. I don't want to be a loser. Everybody at my school is rich and attractive. I am weird and ugly. I have no time for self-improvement, because 1) I needed to set aside six weeks to recover from my injuries from the car accident and 2) I'm so behind in school. Everyone is sick of me being a loser and not accomplishing anything. Everything is so complicated. What did I do to deserve this? All I do every day is walk back and forth in my room and cry. I want to succeed. It's not fair. I can't find peace and I can't escape
