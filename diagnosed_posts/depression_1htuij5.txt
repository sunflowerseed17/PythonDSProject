On the new years eve, whils't sorrounded by friends and family i suddenly felt empty. I have had this feeling before and for some time, but lately it has gotten stronger.

I am a 19 years old male, still in highschool(not because i'm stupid) and while celebrating new year with friends and family, i suddenly felt out of place and empty. I have more friends back home, but i realised that i am somewhere where i don't want to be. My whole life i have done what others expected of me and me, being afraid of dissapointing them, did it. Seems like everyone around me has everthing figured out what they want in life, while i'm still here questioning what to do tomorrow. I would love to try out new things, but i am terrified of what other people will think of me. For the past week, my thoughts have been all over the place about what to do next and why the things are the way they are. The only time i have experienced happiness is through alchocol and even that lately haven't been enough.

I guess what i'm trying to say is i'm afraid. I don't want to feel sad and pathetic anymore, but i am too afraid to go out and experience new things. Sorry if this is against the rules, i had no where else to go.
