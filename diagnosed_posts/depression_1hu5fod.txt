i'd like to start this off by saying this isn't a cry for help or anything of the such, this is me telling my story & how I ended here with this conclusion.

I'm 20 & this is my note. From the age of 6, i was beaten by my step dad, he'd get drunk as usual then he'd beat my mother then my siblings then me. this lasted until i was 15 when i finally told someone & got put into the care system. i was there for about 2 years. I came out of care to move down to bristol which is where i found a girl. i won't name her but she is everything someone could want or wish for in a person. We had some rough times, we argued sometimes, i said things i wish i could take back. She left a few weeks ago now, it was my fault, a girl kissed me on a night-out, i felt like someone cared. that isn't because the relationship was bad, no, recently i had been becoming distant with everyone, i had been dissociating with everything & everyone. i know why, the nightmares have been coming back but that's not important right now. anyway that girl kissed me & i couldn't bring myself to tell her so i told someone else to which her friend overheard & then told her. that's how she came to know. So she left, I can't blame her, who wouldn't?

I'll tell you abit about this girl, i proposed to her. i mean she is wholeheartedly the most loving & caring person I will ever meet in my life, just her presence is enough to make any hurt disappear, she reached into my heart & put it back together again. how she did it, i'll never know but she has no idea how much of a impact she has had on me. she liked to colour in my tattoos, she'd play naughts & crosses on my arm then she'd rub it out even though there was nothing there, it was beautiful. she'd hold things like her phone & pens etc with her pinky & index finger.

all of her things are still here so i'm going to lock myself in the bathroom & end my life in there, she still has keys to the place so if i do it in there she won't see me. All my life, i've never really shown emotion, even with her. I've always just put on my big boy pants & tried my best to make sure she had everything she wanted, until recently, I thought that's what she wanted, no, I couldn't be further from the truth if i tried. She wanted me to talk to her. just typing this, it's almost like i can feel her presence like she's trying to stop me.

She'll probably never see this but in the off chance she does, I love you more than i can put into words, you are the greatest person I've ever met & I hope with every fiber of my being that you go out there & get everything you want in life. You deserve the world & I'm sorry I couldn't give that to you.

Thank you & Goodbye.
