I don’t know how long I can go on like this, I’m at a very bad point in my life where I’m getting treated pretty badly at home and my living situation is pretty bad, I live with my mom and my sister and we’re pretty much living paycheck to paycheck and I’m getting blamed for all of it although I do feel like it’s my fault idk how long I can handle the hate anymore I just want to leave and do something with my life, my dream is to move to the US and pursue being a streamer as it’s always been a dream of mine and a few people told me I’ve got a good personality for it however it’s impossible to get in I’m dead broke and have no qualifications I may or may not be doing a 1 year course on IT or software development to try and get an internship there but I feel like even that won’t help I feel so doomed and don’t know what to do anymore I had a dream last night that I was speaking to a famous streamer about my situation and he was gonna help me out and I needed up in America and I was with the girl that I like but now that I’m awake I feel severely depressed that none of it was real and I’m still in this horrible reality and I just wanna know how do I become that guy who had it all the job the happiness being where I wanted to be with who I wanted to be with. I genuinely feel like I’m done and can’t go on anymore and one of these days I’m gonna be to tired to wake up, I know it’s wrong to say this but how can some people be so lucky and privileged while I suffer like this and can barely think about living
