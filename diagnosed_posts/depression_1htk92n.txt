I feel so damn depressed, as unreasonable as it sounds I even feel like the universe hate me, so many things happened so rapidly one after another, and it feels hopeless and never ending,  I know I don't have it as bad as others, and I'm not saying it either, but I need to vent..

This all started about 7 months ago, my grandma (who I feel along with my brother and my popop are the only ones who truly love me) who has always been there for me had a heart attack and needed to change her life forever and take meds to keep her alive that also cost a way too much, by this point my work sitchuation has gotten really bad and I needed a new job were I can pay for all these new expenses, realizing how it's not sustainable I did some risks and ended up jobless

After a couple weeks things settled down in terms of new life routine, though I was still jobless I was focusing on enjoying my break while I looked (I don't really take vacations cause I need money) and I had a chance to, while on this break, focused on trying to bring In my stray (rando) was taking care of for about more then a year, when I noticed his rapidly deteriorating health, this devastated me because I wanted to help him for so long and when giving the chance he gets stomach cancer, only slightly more then a week he died waiting to see me again on the back porch

2 weeks later i was still recovering from Randos death when something worse happen, bobble my best friend and pet got really sick, a week later, he died of liver failure, we tried to save him, but we were literally a single day late, while all this was happening my mom relentlessly yelled at me about being jobless, roughly every 4 days or so, telling me to "beg for your job back rn" or "i don't care what job it is, just get one right now" I would tell her I can't do that cause I would lose money on Uber cause I don't have a car, she didn't care though

A few more weeks later I bent the knee but lucked out (so I thought) I got a new job with a really good pay (until the meetings happenedðŸ“Œ) but the people were assholes, when I messed up on something (first 2 days btw) they would legit do like anger eyes at me, or be "what the hell or you doing" or if I had a question like "who's this product for" they wouldn't help and say bs like "it's for Joe momma", i still didn't know anything enough so all this really hindering my learning, ðŸ“Œ things became less affordable when we started doing meetings to this corporate building every 2 weeks, I told them it cost too much and this wasn't in the job description, they didn't give a fuck saying be there or he fired, roughly around this time I have a accident with a knife and needed to go to the ER, and not even a day later they were demanding that I go to work immediately or be fired,, once again during all this my mom was saying it isn't good enough, and that I wasnt good enough and I needed to work with my sister in this new job, and she'll help me with Uber cost, I was really thinking about it cause I just couldn't argue anymore, so I applied


I started working at the new job, when my grandma fell and cracked her skull, while at the hospital she then had a stroke, she even currently is learning how to walk and talk again, she also has memory issues, which was particularly sad cause my grandma once said "my biggest fear is having memory issues", while all this was happening my new job started showing bad signs too, like they lied about the amount I get paid, the hours are too much being 10 hour Mon to Thurs, then 11 on Friday, my sister refusing to help me with rides leading me to be stuck out in the cold for hours waiting til Uber gets cheeper and also making me still pay way too much for Uber, when I ask for help getting home from I hear from my mom is "find out your own way home" then I got sick from that, and I haven't been able to visit my grandma in 2 weeks

I only 2 days to truly live by this point, the first day usually spent recovering from the week (I hate being unproductive) and traveling (when I can visit grandma), I wasn't able to work on my passions for so long by this point, I just with thing will get better, but they actually won't...
