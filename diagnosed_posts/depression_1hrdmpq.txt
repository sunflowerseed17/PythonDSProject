And I really can’t think of anything in the past decade that makes me happy that I didn’t do it. In fact my life is worse than it was before and I really don’t know why I’m still here other than that I’m too chicken to actually kill myself. Everything has just gotten shittier and every year I just feel more and more hopeless and worthless. The only noteworthy thing that I can think of is that I went to college and got a degree but it’s not like I’m even using it for anything. It was just a waste of time and money and the debt I got from it is just another burden I have to deal with. 

I don’t even know where I’ll be in the next ten years. It scares me to think about it. I’d like to think maybe I’ll be dead but I think I’ll probably just rot away in misery like I do every day and everything will just continue to get worse like it has. My depression is the only thing I know for certain isn’t going away. Is this what life is? Just shit? Every day? 

It just gives me so much shame to think about how every hope and dream I might’ve had to have a good life is just gone and I’ve hit rock bottom and somehow found a way to dig even deeper. Child me would be so ashamed to know what I’ve become. I’d probably kill myself if I knew. Or maybe I wouldn’t. I probably wouldn’t. 

Here’s to 2025 I guess. Another year of the same shit. Another year of nothing good. I can’t wait.
