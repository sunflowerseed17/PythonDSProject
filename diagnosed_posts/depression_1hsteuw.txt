First of all, I’m extremely ugly and I’m definitely never going to get a boyfriend. So that rules out being a mother. But whatever, I don’t really like men and I would be a terrible mother. 

That would be great if I could find a good job. Not a a great job, but something that at least pays more than minimum wage. I hate my retail job and I’m absolutely miserable there, but it’s literally all I have. 

The only real thing that I love are my cats, as sad as that sounds. I think as soon as they die, I’m just going to go with them. It’s almost torture having them because I always think about them dying and it makes me cry uncontrollably. 

Idk everything about my life just makes me feel like I’m not meant to be here. I was raised Christian and I stopped believing. But there’s still part of me that thinks that there is a god and they made a mistake with me. Like I slipped through the cracks and I’m not supposed to be here.
