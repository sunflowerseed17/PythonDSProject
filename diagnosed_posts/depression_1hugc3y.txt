Hello everyone I'm 18m and for awhile now I've been thinking about suicide I've been having these thoughts since I was 16 I just feel worthless as of rn I'm the only one working due to my mom having heart problems so it prevents her to work and unfortunately I can't afford her treatment so seeing her everyday where she's either out of breath or her chest starts to hurt makes hate myself knowing there's a way to help it's just I can't, and living with my brother doesn't help he usually lashes out on us saying we are the reason we live like this and saying things like we don't even matter to him, hearing that from someone I looked up to hurt.The closet I've come to suicide was when I held a gun to my head I was in my room I was just about to pull them my mom knocked on my door saying dinner was ready, to this day she has no knowledge that she saved nor does she know that I'm having these thought, theres also a lot more to it but this post is long enough. And Sorry if this post was rough I'm new to Reddit.
