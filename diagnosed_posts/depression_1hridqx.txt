It's happened again. Every time. I meet someone new and it seems like it's going well but then it changes and I realise I'm annoying them and I don't mean anything to them. They just like the attention I give them and that's all I can give anyone I have no other value. They're pretending they like me, I'm nothing. I am so desperate to feel affection/attention that I worship these people in my head, they can do no wrong. I fucking hate being this way why does my brain torture me this way I'm sat in bed writing this through my tears AGAIN. This is like the second time, second person in a week there is something wrong with me.
