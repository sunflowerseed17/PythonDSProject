i know 17 is still young and i'm not even an adult yet, but i'm a senior in HS, barely made any friends in my HS years, almost never talk to any of them outside of school, i dont have any classes with them bc i got bad grades so i never see them, i wasted chances to build relationships in my school even though i really wanted too, just never overcame my social anxiety. i wasted time to make memories i'll never get back. i just feel really sad and scared right now. i feel like i'm missing something or someone in my life that i need badly. i feel myself becoming more and more isolated and alone as time goes on. i can see everyone starting to go their own way in life and the chance to make friends with them quickly slipping. the thought of me never talking to my old friends again scares me. where will i even make friends after HS? i'm just fucking scared of becoming old. i'm so used to being the youngest in the family and getting babied. nothing was ever my fault and i never got a feeling of responsibility. i didn't get to grow up properly bc of how awful and depressed i've become the last few years with covid fucking over my development. i just wish i was normal i live with constant frustration in myself.
