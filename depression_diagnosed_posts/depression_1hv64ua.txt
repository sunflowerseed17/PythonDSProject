I am stuck and wanna go away from this world .I am a jee aspirant but my situation is terrible. All the colleges around me torture me all the ppl around me hates me from the bottom of their hearts i always get fake ppl and fake frnds in my life. Fake relationship and frnds. I think our contry got independence along back but the students are still trapped in verification system of our education system. In IIT u must score 75+ in boards and then compete with 16-18 lks ppl for limited 10,000 seats once u r not able to cleaar IIT all the ppl around u and society will start commenting on your abilities and calibre the truth is that ppl find it gud to see others failing and when a students returns back home after giving 200â„… of him in coaching and facing all this shit in life his parents start taunting him and comparison with the class or block toppers the student simply breaks becoz of the load of expectations and burden on him and then takes that action that is too common these days ITS NOT STUDENTS FAULT IT IS THE SOCIETY THAT MAKES HIM DO THAT . even i am BROKEN and tired of fighting byee........ ðŸ›Œ
