I (25F) have a lot of hidden anger and resentment towards my mom. I know I can’t make excuses for myself, but I’ve always known something’s been off about our relationship since I was about 14.  As I have a genetic disability, it is genuinely hard for me to focus and do simple tasks. I’ve gone into a depression/ suicidal ideation seeing my classmates succeed and I’m still at home. I know nothing about insurance, finance, credit scores etc. I also don’t know how to cook or clean properly. It’s affecting me. Ironically my mom is a helicopter parent, and my family tells me I can’t do certain things. I freeze up anytime I try to do a simple task. I’m on leave from work, and my mom is saying she’ll cover me if I get the mental help which I’ve agreed to. But then, she starts talking about us doing weights together, going on trips to France etc. I’ve noticed a pattern in my family, we make excuses for everything. I’m trying to stop that myself because I’m a product of my environment and I hate it. I’ve also noticed another thing I’ve unfortunately got from my family, we ALWAYS think something is physically wrong with us. And it drives me insane. I’ve thought about dying my whole life, so I haven’t really had a plan for my future. It’s scary because I’m only getting older. Am I ungrateful for having anger and resentment towards my mom? Am I crazy? And also, I feel like she’s exaggerated about my “learning disability”. I’m just lost, depressed, and confused. I
