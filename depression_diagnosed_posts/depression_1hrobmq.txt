I am a 14yr old boy who has been struggling with suicidal depression for around a year now. I see a therapist but it doesn’t really seem to be helping me. I guess I just feel lonely and isolated, I feel as almost no one can relate to me or know what I’m truly going through. 

I talk to some people about it but they (2 close girl best friends), but they just say the same stuff like “it’s gonna be okay, and that sucks”  I know they really don’t want to be in that conversation and don’t know how to respond. I feel like I’m just projecting this matter of my own upon them knowing they can’t actually do anything to fix me. I just wanna find someone to relate too…

any advice for getting out of this shithole I dug?
