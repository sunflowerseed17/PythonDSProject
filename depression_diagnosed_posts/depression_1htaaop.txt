It's been a heck of a year. I got divorced. Had a major surgery that's kept me out of work for months, and now today my 78 year old dad drops a bombshell on me. He's getting serious with a new woman. My mother passed away in 2017, he remarried to an old girlfriend in 2018. She passed away in August this year. The new woman he's interested in, in his words - 'getting serious with', lives halfway across the country with her boyfriend. Oh, and she's 47. Just barely older than me by a few years. He met her on some phone app game he plays. I gave him every possible warning a person could give. We discussed romance scams, how risky this is, and the practical implications of the entire scenario. He also told me about two other women he's been talking to on that app, that are closer to him. He went into detail about how they found him attractive and how desirable he must appear to them. He plans to bring the 47 year old down here to meet him and us - his family. 

Ultimately, he's going to do what he's going to do. I've long been debating going no contact with my dad for various reasons (mostly related to narcissism) but this is just more reason to do so. The most alarming thing about today was how happy he seemed to tell me about these women and unbothered he was about my warnings. I've never seen him act like this at all.

Sorry if this seems kinda random and venting, I've had a few drinks and not sure how to process this. Just a few years ago, when my mom was still alive, I looked up to my dad and we were really close. We could talk about anything and did a lot together. Now, being around him raises my anxiety, heart rate, and even a short conversation with him leaves me drained.
