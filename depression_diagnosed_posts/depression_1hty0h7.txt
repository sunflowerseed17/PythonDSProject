Practically my days right now feel like drags. I have a girlfriend and I more than anything try respecting her boundaries but when we do something she gets uncomfortable and tells my she liked it and then the next day just to be told she didn't like it and then we do something else and then cycle. I give hope because she's my girlfriend and it makes her happy, but this is just pissing me off. Then I'm really emotional, which makes me feel weak and pathetic because I'm supposed to be a man. But all I want to do is cry and be held by mother that died 5 years ago. I want her more than anything in this world. She died from a heart attack while sleeping and I look every corner and just pray it was a lie. It's stupid to think but I really want her back. 

This to I feel lonely when I come home from a day out. There's one notification I got a message and it was from Facebook telling me my friend is online. It's fine I really don't care anymore. I just play video games to escape sometimes. Though when I am out and I'm like say with my gal. Sometimes I just want her to understand I'm unbelievably sad and I want care. Today I was doing my fu@#$_& best to keep everyone happy. Her parents were fighting because she and her mom brought rats over for pets the dads pissed about the price. Her little sisters and my girlfriend are all heated while I'm trying to keep the littles happy. Try making the mom's mood better and support my girlfriend because I know at the time she needs to be love and cared on. But in the end of the day I do all of this just to cry on my bed and complain to Reddit of how I'm a fu-$+-@ joke and people are going through so much worse and what I'm going through is a easy breeze in the park. I feel so stressed and overwhelmed that all I want to do is kill myself. I'm sorry for all this thank you for listening to me though. This is what I really want more than most things right now, someone to actually listen.
