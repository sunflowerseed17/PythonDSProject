Iâ€™m 22/f and as soon as I got out of high school I lost touch with pretty much all of my friends due to family issues and because of that became very much a hermit and have lost all my social skills. I have very little social stamina and even if I do feel like talking to people I have a hard time connecting with anyone. Im very lonely and I hate my life but I just feel incapable of making or keeping friends. What can I do?
