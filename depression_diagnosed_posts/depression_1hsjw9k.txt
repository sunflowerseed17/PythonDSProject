My parents had me in their late 40's. I believe they were too tired for me. I felt they were emotionally absent and have rare memories of them playing with me.

When I got old enough to go to school, I was the shortest and made fun of for being ugly. I was made fun of especially for not having athletic skill, always picked last for all things. I had smarts but it only got me called a nerd. Pinched and kicked when I asked to play with people who didn't think I belonged. Teachers were not able to protect me. I was either alone on the playground or with one or two other rejects. 

This persisted my whole life. Few friends. Lonely, difficult trusting myself to others to make friends. Low social skills. Isolation and therefore depression with a lot of fear of ridicule -- and especially losing people. I think I copied through frequent pornography use.

I wanted to ask the community if you have had any experience with anything that helps someone with chronic loneliness, shame, and a life devoid of celebration.

I don't mean to be a downer, just wanted to share my story and genuinely seek help.

I have a therapist but I have crises between appts where things feel like all is lost frequently.
