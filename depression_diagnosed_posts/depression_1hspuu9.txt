I don’t know if I am or not. Not diagnosed. What I do know is I miss the youthfulness I had when I was younger. I’m 33M, have less than a handful of friends and none that I would consider my “best” friend at this point. The friends I do have I feel like I have to make an effort to keep up with, most of the time I feel like I’m forcing them to hang out with me. I’m very antisocial, I don’t know how to talk to people. 

I like to play video games, online MMOs to be exact, and even in an online anonymous setting I don’t know how to talk to people so I just end up playing alone anyways. I find myself often thinking about how alone I feel. I have a wife and kids, certainly family time with them helps ease this intense feeling of loneliness that I have. But that easing is only temporary, and the moment I’m back in a social setting with strangers, online or otherwise, the loneliness creeps back in. 

I don’t have suicidal thoughts, but I have thought about if I wasn’t here would anybody really notice. My wife and kids certainly would, and maybe that’s all that should matter to me but I can’t help thinking like this.
