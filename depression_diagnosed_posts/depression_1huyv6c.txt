When I wake up in the morning I have thoughts in my mind, so many so if I stay in bed I get a headache and feeling extremely unwell during the morning and become suicidal. I am so depressed and I try to think it is just temporary but I am so weak and my mood is very very low. All day I feel like a zombie. When I just get out of bed once I woke up I am tired but I am a totally different person from what I described previously. I am fine, I am ok, I have energy, I love doing things, can concentrate on reading. Is anybody with the same problem? What do you do?
I am also on meds, thats fine. I am really suprised the difference in my body and mind when I wake up or when I stay in bed a little bit longer. I feel like being depressed was in the last month and now I am just fine, but this experience was just another day.
