I (28M) have been suffering from severe depression all weekend. Laying on my floor in my parents house crying. Girlfriend of 14 months knows how down I was this weekend and canceled plans we had for dinner tonight for dinner with another friend (from out of state but still needs at least 1 time per month and just saw each other last week). When you already feel worthless how do you deal with the one person who is supposed to be there for you ditching you at your lowest?

Will post more in edits but just needed to post to get this off my chest
