1. I can’t take anti depressants. I’ve tried several, they make me suicidal/numb. I essentially always get the extreme side effects.
2. I can’t -really- get outside anyways, I have autoimmune diseases that make me EXTREMELY sensitive to cold, in pain, worse off.
3. I was a college athlete. Absolutely a grind. It was great for my mental health. Distance running for the last 8 years. However I have retired my career earlier than expected as I have permanent knee and ankle injuries. 

With this in mind- what do I do. 
I hope I don’t sound too whiney, I just feel as though I have completely lost myself. I am so unhappy lol! Bitching and moaning on Reddit wasn’t my first resort. I have also read several self help books, and it may have just been the few I’ve picked up, but they r kind like, just don’t be sad! Anyways, I appreciate any advice. I’m burning out. Please be kind.
