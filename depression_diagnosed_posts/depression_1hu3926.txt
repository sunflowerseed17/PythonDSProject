Hello everyone, I don’t know why I am writing this here as they’re people here with real problems and thinking or contemplating suicide. But last night I found my dad dead on his floor. I don’t know the cause of death yet but the paramedics said he had been dead at least a few hours. He had been really ill and depressed for last years. His neighbours comforted me and I honestly wouldn’t think I’d be here if it wasn’t for them holding me. I’ve been completely numb all night and haven’t slept and I’m not sure if I feel suicidal yet. 
However I do want to say for anyone who is contemplating suicide or feeling like they want to hurt themselves I ask you to please don’t do it! No matter how bad or alone you feel please don’t do it, people will care more than you know it! And you’ll be putting them through the worst pain imaginable! Don’t suffer alone and please no matter how alone you feel someone cares about you more than you think and the pain of not seeing someone again is unbearable! I feel like I could have done more to prevent this happening and I feel I will never forgive myself for not checking on him more. 
Sorry if this doesn’t read well I haven’t slept for over 24 hours. 

If anyone is feeling suicidal or needs someone to talk to I can’t sleep and I’m here
