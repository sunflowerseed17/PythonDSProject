My ex, the one. Well who I thought was, is trying to add me again after 7 years. Wtf do I do? I don't go a day without some kind of thought of her. I've dated girls before and after but nothing felt like this. As a boyfriend I failed completely by the end of our relationship and lost the only person who I could truly be myself around. That person is long gone. Probably even worse now, all the drinking on top of alienating myself from majority of my social life minus 2 friends. He's never come back and and never was she so why now? Does she wanna just be friends again? Does she just want to talk about things? Does she want to make sure I'm unhappy? I don't know but i don't think I can handle either way. Maybe I should have worked on myself more in this time and I'd know... maybe I should of tried harder to leave all this.. all I know is I'll never be what she deserved while I was with her. I truly hope she's happy now and sees how special she is, and with someone that shows her. Im so fucked in the head. No, I just dont think of you as the one for me. You are, and I fucked it up with all the anger and control that I pushed upon you. Losing you was the hardest thing I have ever dealt with, even tho it was needed. I'm sickened by who I was toward you and never want to be like that again. I try to maintain my anger and be very concious of my mood, but there's no point. I don't want to be that person for anyone else. All she did was add me this long after it ended and I feel this bad, can't imagine how I made her feel. Maybe this is deserved
