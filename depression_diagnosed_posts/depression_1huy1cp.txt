Feel like I have nothing to live for. I don’t have a career. I lost contact with all my old friends and now the only person I speak to consistently in person is my boyfriend and the couple of online friends I contact from time to time. I’ve just turned 25 and I have no idea what direction I want to take my life. I did a degree in a field I was never really interested in but felt pressured to because of expectations and a lack of direction. I am still living at home though actively searching for a place to rent, but the rental market is so fucked in Australia. But part of me wonders if renting in the same town I have grown up all my life would even make a difference to my mental state. Part of me wants to move somewhere far with my boyfriend but I feel like that would involve having some idea what I want to do with my life, in which I have none. 

Literally the only thing that is stopping me from killing myself these days is my boyfriend (who bless his soul is about the only good thing in my life) and the mere fact it would hurt.
