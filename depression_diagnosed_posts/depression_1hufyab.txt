why do i do this, why do i torture myself every day. everything i want to do seems so pointless, and it only gets worse. i can't even work properly because my body is broken. i am so useless, and have never done anything right. i have always been the shame of the family, and that will never end. i have been struggling with depression for 10 years, ever since my stepfather sexually abused me, i hate myself and my life. i try to fight, but i don't have the strength. I'm desperate and don't know what to do, I just want to be able to sleep properly for once, but even for that I'm too worthless.
