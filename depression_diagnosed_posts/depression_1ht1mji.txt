I’ve been some degree of depressed for the last 20 years. I’ve always had trouble tapping into and expressing my emotions with others, but also with myself. In the past, I was able to use alcohol as a pressure relief valve to lean into the darker feelings for a time, have a sob, and allow myself to function more regularly for a couple days afterwards. Recently I’ve had to give up drinking, and I’ve also had a lot of shitty things happen in my life recently. I’m having a hard time finding something to replace the drinking. So now the depression just feels like a constant looming presence with no relief. I’m aware plenty of people experience this all the time with no relief, but was just curious if anyone had any guidance or advice they could give me on how to deal with this or find new avenues of release. Thanks
