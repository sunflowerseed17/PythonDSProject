I truly and openly feel awful for people living with and suffering from depression. It must be incredibly difficult and makes you feel misunderstood on the daily basis. Especially during the most difficult phases when depression has a grasp on you. 

I am married to someone who has depression. We have been together for 20 years and I am now finding it so difficult to support and be present when the dark times hit him. I find I begin to feel resentful and frustrated and these feelings are new. That’s why I’m here: these feelings of helplessness and resentment are all new. 

I feel hurt when the family is impacted by the sadness that my husband feels during these times. No one can feel joy in the house and nothing helps. 

What is your advice to us living with those with depression? If we can’t help, do we give space? Do you feel angry with us because we feel frustrated? We love you and care for you and grieve with your pain as well. 

I am worried it’s tearing us apart as I can no longer find it in me to be supportive as depression often comes with anger and other bad emotions. Please help us help you. 

I ask with love, compassion and understanding.
