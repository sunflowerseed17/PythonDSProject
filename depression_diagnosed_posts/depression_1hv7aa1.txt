I am 24f and extremely depressed. 

The last time I felt this way I was about 16, but this time it’s much worse. Nothing makes me happy, I’ve started drinking more to cope. The worst part is I have nothing to be depressed about. I recently got promoted, I’m going to school, my family loves me but yet I can’t shake this feeling. I don’t feel like myself and have also been struggling with derealization, which is so scary. I feel like I’m watching myself fade away. The only reason why I get out of bed is because of my job.
