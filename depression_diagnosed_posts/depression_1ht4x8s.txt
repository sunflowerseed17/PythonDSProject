I just flipped out on my brother for not giving my cat, who is still at my dad’s house, his thyroid medicine. I just snapped on my dad for my brother not doing this. I just snapped on my friends for wanting me to go out for someone’s birthday tomorrow. I’m on idk what dose of amitryptiline or whatever it is and even though this must be the 6 or 7 medication I’ve been given, all I want to do is kms. It doesn’t make me feel any better. I really didn’t mean it. But I did it and words can’t be taken back. 

I am a shitty person who is nothing more than a doormat for people to walk on. My mother always said some people were put on this planet solely to be the dumping ground for everyone’s problems and I wholeheartedly believe that’s the only reason I’m here. I can’t seem to successfully off myself with pills so I’m stuck pissing off every single person I come across.
