I have a 35 year old friend, who I have been friends with for 13 years, he is very kind and sweet, I know he struggles with mental health and takes medicine and sees a psychiatrist, his mood and stability has changed alot in the years I’ve known him in great ways….that being said. The man will not work!! His dad pays all his bills and he is constantly sitting around smoking weed begging people to come hang out because shocker, he isn’t around anyone because he refuses to stay in a job and make money to do things with. I can’t be there for him everytime he’s bored and lonely, but he begins to fall into a deep depression whenever I am to busy. I am a single mom working all the time to make ends meet, and it kills me that he just gets to mooch off his father and stay home all day. I know he isn’t not working because of his mental health, he just doesn’t see the point in working because he thinks jobs are bullcrap, needless to say we are the opposite in that department. My question is how do I handle this? I know everyone’s situation is different and I don’t want to drop him because he’s not a fully functioning adult but damn! What’s the end goal here? Do I just keep enabling him too since his whole family does? I don’t want to be another reason for his depression to worsen but, it’s really starting to get to me off his lack of trying in general.
