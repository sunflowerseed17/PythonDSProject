pretty much what was in the title. I have been to many different hospitals. they all discharge me eventually, even with active suicidal ideation. 

  
my last conversation with the psychiatrist was like this

"how are you feeling today?"

"just spent the entire day thinking about dying."

"Ok. Well, we are still going to discharge you."

 "so you think I will be ok?"

"I do not have a magic crystal ball, but yes."

I mean, if drinking so much alcohol I have to get IV fluids and zofran, is considered ok, then I guess I am ok. that's what happened last night. i don't ever drink.
