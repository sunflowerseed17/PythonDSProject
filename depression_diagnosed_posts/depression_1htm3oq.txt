I am only 33 and I already live day by day. No future plans, already given up. I can´t understand how I already gave up. I look young, physicially there´s nothing wrong. But I just can´t see it anymore. Whenever I think about work, or starting over with something my brain instantly shuts down. The pressure becomes too high and I give up instantly. The last couple of job interviews I didn´t even show up anymore. It´s turned into a joke. I never felt like I can live the way I want to in this society. Why is it nowadays that your whole existence is a fucking CV, or a fucking Linkedin page. Life seems like a fucking competition and the cool stuff is disappearing more and more. Why am I withering away, it´s undeserved
