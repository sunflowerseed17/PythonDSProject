that pretty much sums it up. this happens a lot, more than twice a week. i’m a student, so i’m distracted a lot of the time i suppose. yet it manages to weasel its way in, the sadness that is. this started fairly recently, or so i’ve finally put a finger on what’s happening fairly recently. i had been in therapy and counseling since kindergarten and i myself have never really known why. i stopped in 2023 because i didn’t want to feel like i needed to talk to someone every week. i think it’s the vulnerability. nonetheless, this sadness, i describe it as like a black goo seeping into my brain slowly taking over. i’ll mention these feelings, and i’ve even mentioned this dilemma to my mother, she just tells me that if i have no reason to be sad, then i shouldn’t be. she tells me that if distractions are preventing me from being sad i should just stay distracted. the thing is i don’t want to be distracted all the time, i want to be able to sit with myself and just think without breaking into sobs. i think that’s about everything this has to offer that previous sentence being my real want and i just want some advice on this subject. is there an answer or explanation as to what this is and what it holds for me? i don’t exactly know what subreddit? to put this in, so my apologies if this is the wrong one. i am new to this whole thing
