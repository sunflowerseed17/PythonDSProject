No this isn't a suicide declaration or anything like that. But I think it's time I properly try to clean up my life and aim to be the best I can possibly be. I've hit the lowest point of my life right now and to be quite honest I'm done I don't want to feel this way anymore I'm just tired of waking up everyday and being miserable and pretending to my friends and family that I'm ok, I'm tired of the anxiety, I'm tired of the weight gain, I'm tired of the low grades, I'm tired of lying to myself that I'm ok when every waking moment I think about ways to kill myself and that "today will be the day or tomorrow for sure", I'm tired of letting this bullshit consume my life and eat away at who I am. I think...no I believe that starting now I will actually heal and will to do better because I believe it's possible for anyone to break free from the illness that is depression. I'm going to counseling again, I'm going to the gym again, and God as my witness I'm going to fix my dogshit college grades, I'm going to stop the masking and aim to be myself no more excuses. To anyone reading this honestly depression sucks and low-key living can also suck too but I want to go out with my friends, I want to do well in college, maybe one day meet someone nice, I want to wake up in the fucking morning and not think about KILLING myself I want to live man I want to live so badly. I want to look myself in the mirror and to see something whole in the next few years. I have to accept that I fucked up and that quite frankly I am fucked up and work on ways to unfuck myself. Again to anyone reading this you're 100% not alone don't let this consume you change takes time and with time things always get better.
