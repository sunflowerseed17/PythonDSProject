I just got back from being in the hospital for 3 days. I almost died because I waited so long to to go but being back home I see how much of a mess it is and I feel like I’ve failed as an adult. I live by myself but it’s such a mess. Since being home for the first time all I’ve done is lay down and watch tv while I try to get back to full health but I feel so bad about not doing anything as soon as I got home. I still feel so sick and tired. Am I a bad person? I don’t have pets or anything else to take care of. Just me. I still feel like a failure. Am I wrong for waiting to clean? I could barely shower without falling over..
