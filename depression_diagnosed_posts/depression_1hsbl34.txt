I honestly don't feel alive anymore and I don't know what to do. I am so. Close. To writing those letters just because I can't take it anymore. I don't know what to do though, because I know my best friend couldn't live without me, but I really just want to escape. I genuinely just want to die and I feel like I can't take it anymore and I just want out. What should I do?
