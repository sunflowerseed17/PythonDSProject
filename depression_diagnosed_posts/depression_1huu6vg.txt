I havent posted here in quite a long time. life has been going decently well for me, and i was happy for a while. although some parts of my life im happy with, there are some parts that arent. theres parts of me that are sad and unhappy that im not who i used to be. im not sad all the time anymore, i dont think about not wanting to be here anymore. what i miss right now is not being able to control my feelings and my wants and needs. i stopped myself from eating all the time, and it stuck with me. i was skinnier and i was happy. i liked myself so much better, then i let it slip. im so fat and ugly now, i hate myself. this is the start of it again, i will try not to eat. i will eat as little as i can. i will not be upset about it. i will not be mad about it. i will not complain. i will be happy. i will be better. i will be sad with myself when do i eat. i will be happy with myself when i dont eat. i will be better.
