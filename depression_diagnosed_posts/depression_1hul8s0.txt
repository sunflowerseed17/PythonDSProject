I am a gay 21M and I feel really stuck. I am on winter break from my senior year of college. Most of my friends are in my hometown. Usually the lonely fall college semester makes me depressed and coming home is a good break that reminds me the joy in life. However this year, the depression seems to have followed me and worsened at home. When I hang with my friends I just know I am draining their energy because I have no idea what to say, my mind being only focused on anxiety and depression.

I see everyone struggling to make conversation with me, bringing up random things in an effort for them to remember why I am their friend. My replies usually are dead ends, since i am so in my head about how much of a boring person I am I can't think of anything productive to say. I see them with other people and conversation just looks so easy to them. I want to go back to school so I can be in solitude for a long while, but I have a scary feeling I will never feel like myself again, since school is the place this all originated. I also agonize over every decision, even little things, and I always feel like I choose the wrong one.

I used to be a creative and funny person, now I feel completely filled with despair and worry. I don't think I want to die, but it almost feels like the only option since I just wanna go back in time or be someone else. Can anyone relate to this and tell me how they got out of it?

I just started with a new therapist and i am on wellbutrin/ceroquel, they both really don't make much of a difference.
