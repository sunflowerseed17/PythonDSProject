Hi everyone. 

About two months ago I got prescribed Fluoxetine and it’s helped me a TON. My overall mood is ten times better and I actually feel generally content with life again. 

That being said, about a month ago I was unable to take my pills for a little bit over two weeks because of complications with my pharmacy. I managed to get a new box a couple weeks ago and have been taking them again. 

The first time I started taking them, I had basically no side effects at all but now I’ve restarted them, I’m having suuuper weird and vivid dreams every single night. Sometimes it’s nightmares and other times it’s just a bit odd. When I wake up, I feel really disoriented and it takes me a few minutes to feel normal. 

There’s no mention of dreams on my side effects leaflet but I’ve seen a few people mention it in various places online. Has anyone here had any experience like this on any meds? I’m wondering why I’m suddenly experiencing it now that I’ve restarted taking my medication. 

Any input would be super appreciated. Thanks! ❤️
