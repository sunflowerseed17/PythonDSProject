I've been depressed for 2 years and a half. I am currently 18, and I really wanna stop existing. I hate turning 18 just like I did with 17 and 16. I never feel excitement, happiness or pleasure/joy no matter what I do or where I am. I am always completely anhedonic for no reason. I spent my days thinking about the past, crying, thinking about death and how useless everything is. I think about how everyone else is just a loser who will end up dying like me but just later. I always feel like I am insane.  Really wanna die like wtf.
