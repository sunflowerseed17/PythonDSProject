I have been going through some things exacerbated by my depression and anxiety but also partly caused by it. Unfortunately, it seems like my unstable nature had caused riffs between me and my friends. Even if they forgive me, I can't look at them without feeling like I'll never forgive myself.

I pushed them away, scared them when I would say I was feeling suicidal or that I wanted to hurt myself. I thought that I could never br a villain, but I feel like I've caused so much damage. I've just haven't been a good person like I thought I was. I don't feel like a good person, at all. 

I don't know how to forgive myself, and I'm scared I won't change.
