i feel so depressed and lonely and i am so scared that it’s always going to be this way. i’ve been really struggling with trying not to relapse with my self harm but it’s just getting so hard and i feel so overwhelmed and alone and just like everything is my fault. i feel like i take a few steps forward and then im right back here again…. it’s driving me insane and i just want to scream and rip myself apart
