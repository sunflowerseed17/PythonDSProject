I was just wondering, would it be okay to live just for myself and not expect anything. Cause i am struggling with suicidal thoughts, so after doing some stuff i came to this decision to just live. I mean it, no matter how poor or bad my life will be, i decided to live. I have no energy to be better, only to exist
