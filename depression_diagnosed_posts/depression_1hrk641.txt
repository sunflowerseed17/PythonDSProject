I am 16. I feel very lonely every single day of my day. I don't exaggerate if I say I have one friend, but he doesn't really like spending time with me. I haven't seen him in two weeks because he's always busy with his friends. I only see him when all his other friends can't hang out. I feel like shit. Please, if you need someone to talk, I can help you. I am a good listener, but I can also talk a lot and I reply fast
