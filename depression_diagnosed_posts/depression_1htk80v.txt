i dont think anyone i know, whether its family or friends, realizes how lowly i think of myself. how deeply i hate my entire existence and how badly i wish i was never born. i wasnt meant to be alive. i dont know why my mom didnt have an abortion when she was pregnant with me and ive even said that to her during a breakdown when i was a teenager. im 25F now and besides my dogs, the only reason i havent killed myself is because im afraid of the unknown that comes with dying
