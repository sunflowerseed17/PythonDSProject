I’m 24 years old, I’m in a never ending abyss of sadness. I cut myself constantly and feel ashamed and weak as a man. Almost worthless. I try my hardest to pretend this pain doesn’t affect me but it’s getting to a point of no return. Im constantly alone and it hurts me deeply. I feel hopeless, I can’t sleep. I wish I was normal but I seem to ask myself “what is normal?” Alone is a concept for me that I’ve endured my whole life. I’m at war with depression, I tell myself everyday “you got this” but clearly I’m lost. When I cry it hurts, my wish when I was 18 was that I’d be dead by the age of 21, and now here look at me at 24, lost, miserable and confused. I WANT TO DIE. I’m always in my head, I’m very insecure about my skin pigment and the way I look. I’m sorry…..shedding tears alone, is a pain only a few can understand. There was blood in my tears :( I’m just tired of the fighting :(
