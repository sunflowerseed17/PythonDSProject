I really feel like dying. I have a lot of health issues that make me disabled, plus at 37 I have to walk with a cane. No one wants to be friends with someone who is disabled. I want to do physical activities but I am not able to. I have nowhere to go socialize around here. The only places to socialize here are bars and churches. Well I am not an alcoholic and I am not religious. So I don't belong in either of those places. I only have one local friend that I can see and talk to, but she is getting more hours at her job and that's going to mean less that I see of her. I can't drive myself anywhere, and I have no one else to talk to or hangout with. I feel like a terrible friend because we can't do anything fun because of my disability. I can't work, and I can't do volunteer work so I can't meet people that way. Since I'll never be able to meet other people, and I'll never be able to be successful I am really considering ending my existence. My own family doesn't even like me. I'm the damn black sheep. My therapist hasn't even been able to give me solutions. Ill just do everyone a favor. ðŸ¥€ðŸ’€ðŸ¥€
