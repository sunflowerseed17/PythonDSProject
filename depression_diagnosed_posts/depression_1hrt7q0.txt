Title: Am I depressed?

To start, I recently switched my job to a higher paying one. No work assigned yet as I am still in onboarding phase. I have been feeling low past 1 month, but I chalked it off as change anxiety because I don't do well with changes and was in the process of changing jobs.

Now that I am at new workplace, I am seeing some significant signs past 3 days: I have bad change anxiety yet managed to switch jobs, I should feel happy and proud, but I just don't feel anything. I am no more interested in my hobbies, I avoid calls from my mom or friends or just pretend I am interested in conversation / happy but I really don't feel much. I am taking baths in the evening because I have to, skipping meals because I don't really feel like eating. I don't feel like going out either.

All I am doing is doom scrolling and watching my comfort show on loop. I wake up at 9-10 AM and it feels like "shit, another day". I have repeated same pattern for past 3-4 days. This isn't hampering my work in any way. I am communicating well with people for onboarding formalities, getting everything done over there.

But, overall I just feel numb & empty. Every day feels like a chore. There is no reason for me to feel those things. Are these really signs of depression? Or it's just a phase and it'll go away like it randomly came?
