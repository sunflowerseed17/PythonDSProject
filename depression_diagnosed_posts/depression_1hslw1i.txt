My dad just made a new child . With a dumb new stepmum . Meanwhile my siblings arent home , since 9 years , they live in a village & they are pretty young idk the exactly age but between 10-12 , no one agrees with me and i got no phone rn my Dad keeps lyieng , my brother hurted his arm . I feel dead rn and i was forced to sleep 3 days at my grannys place. My dad drives 2000 miles to france but not 400 for my siblings . Im out germany btw and im angry but they wont understand . My stepmum is anoying as hell. I feel like just going home and just in my room . Im on xbox rn . I hope somone agrees with me
