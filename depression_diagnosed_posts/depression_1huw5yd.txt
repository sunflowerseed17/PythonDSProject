I don't even know where to start, but I try keeping it short. I already suffer all my life with social anxiety, it used to be a lot worse in the past and I kind of improved, but it still is something constantly following me and making it hard for me to really form new connection to people or to open up to other people. I was never in therapy or anything regarding this topic.

Why do I think I could have depression?

- I used to be very passionate about my job, my company and my work in total. Now It's kind of I just try to get done what is needed, but I don't have any energy for doing more than that.  
-Things I used to be very passionate about just don't do it anymore for me. I don't find any joy anymore in almost anything, I'm trying to find things and try new things out or try new games or whatever, but I just feel nothing.   
- I recognized also some sort of pattern. When I started travelling the first times, I was always so super excited about it as soon as I arrived in a new place. It instantly boosted my mood and I loved to take a break from my normal life. My last trip in December though, idk I was just feeling nothing. I had visited so many cool places which I usually love, and honestly I just felt nothing. This is something actually what is even scaring me, because it was kind of my last thing which made me truly happy, and I would love to continue this thing and feel the excitement again, but It's just not there.

-Sometimes I feel like days just pass, I don't remember things, the days feel the same and I don't even know how to describe what I feel. I forget things people tell me or even if my parents ask me for things, I just don't remember, and I am not doing that on purpose it just disappears.

-I lack very much on energy. Honestly, I'm happy I kind of get my job in some sort done. As soon as I arrive at home I go in bed chill for an hour and go to sleep, I wake up eat chill and I'm just tired. My apartment is a total mess, and I'm even sometimes disgusted of myself, but I don't find the energy or time to fix this. I am sort of happy that at some points when it's needed I get my stuff done like laundry and other things but still it takes a lot of energy. Also getting motivated to get things done, I just can't get myself motivated at all. I used to plan things and be productive during my days, and now I just mostly do nothing, and I hate myself for that reason even more because I feel like I'm wasting all my time away.

-Also, my fight with acne is tiring me extremely. I was on 2 medical therapies with isotretinoin, which made my skin perfect, and I was happy for years. In 2023 my skin got really bad again for some reason. I tried to do so much, and it just did not help, which got me more into the hole of this bad mood. I got it under control again in last year, but now it's again getting more bad, and I also feel hopeless about this as it really drags me down. My social anxiety is making this acne thing even worse because I hide myself when I feel not comfortable about how I look.
  
So yea I used to try dating but even there I just couldn't maintain the connection because I felt like I couldn't handle it. I feel kind of lost and just don't know where to go with my life, I would love to make a change, but I just don't know how.

Coming to the question, does therapy help? Do you think this could be a depression? What would therapy actually do about this? Because I believe that my condition is related to what I am unhappy with. There are several other reasons, but I have tried to keep it short here

I am really happy about any serious advice, because I do want to change things really, I don't want to be like this for the rest of my life.... Thank you for reading, I know it was a lot. Also feel free to share your experience with me, maybe someone was in the same situation and got out of this hole.
